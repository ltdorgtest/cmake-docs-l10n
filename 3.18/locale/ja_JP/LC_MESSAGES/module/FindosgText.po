"This is part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph components.  "
"Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module.  You must "
"also opt into OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer if needed) as these "
"modules won't do it for you.  This is to allow you control over your own "
"system piece by piece in case you need to opt out of certain components or "
"change the Find behavior for a particular module (perhaps because the "
"default FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't work with your system as an "
"example).  If you want to use a more convenient module that includes "
"everything, use the FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake instead of the Findosg*.cmake "
"modules."
