"Executable targets with the :prop_tgt:`MACOSX_BUNDLE` property set are built "
"as macOS or iOS application bundles on Apple platforms.  Shared library "
"targets with the :prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK` property set are built as macOS or "
"iOS frameworks on Apple platforms.  Module library targets with the :"
"prop_tgt:`BUNDLE` property set are built as macOS ``CFBundle`` bundles on "
"Apple platforms.  Source files listed in the target with this property set "
"will be copied to a directory inside the bundle or framework content folder "
"specified by the property value.  For macOS Application Bundles the content "
"folder is ``<name>.app/Contents``.  For macOS Frameworks the content folder "
"is ``<name>.framework/Versions/<version>``.  For macOS CFBundles the content "
"folder is ``<name>.bundle/Contents`` (unless the extension is changed).  See "
"the :prop_tgt:`PUBLIC_HEADER`, :prop_tgt:`PRIVATE_HEADER`, and :prop_tgt:"
"`RESOURCE` target properties for specifying files meant for ``Headers``, "
"``PrivateHeaders``, or ``Resources`` directories."

"If the specified location is equal to ``Resources``, the resulting location "
"will be the same as if the :prop_tgt:`RESOURCE` property had been used. If "
"the specified location is a sub-folder of ``Resources``, it will be placed "
"into the respective sub-folder. Note: For iOS Apple uses a flat bundle "
"layout where no ``Resources`` folder exist. Therefore CMake strips the "
"``Resources`` folder name from the specified location."
