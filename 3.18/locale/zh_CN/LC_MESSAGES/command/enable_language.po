"Enables support for the named language in CMake.  This is the same as the :"
"command:`project` command but does not create any of the extra variables "
"that are created by the project command.  Example languages are ``CXX``, "
"``C``, ``CUDA``, ``OBJC``, ``OBJCXX``, ``Fortran``, and ``ASM``."

"If enabling ``ASM``, enable it last so that CMake can check whether "
"compilers for other languages like ``C`` work for assembly too."

msgid ""
"This command must be called in file scope, not in a function call. "
"Furthermore, it must be called in the highest directory common to all "
"targets using the named language directly for compiling sources or "
"indirectly through link dependencies.  It is simplest to enable all needed "
"languages in the top-level directory of a project."

"The ``OPTIONAL`` keyword is a placeholder for future implementation and does "
"not currently work. Instead you can use the :module:`CheckLanguage` module "
"to verify support before enabling."
