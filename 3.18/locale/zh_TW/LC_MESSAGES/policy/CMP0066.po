"The source file signature of the :command:`try_compile` command uses the "
"value of the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` variable in the test project so "
"that the test compilation works as it would in the main project.  However, "
"CMake 3.6 and below do not also honor config-specific compiler flags such as "
"those in the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG` variable.  CMake 3.7 and "
"above prefer to honor config-specific compiler flags too.  This policy "
"provides compatibility for projects that do not expect config-specific "
"compiler flags to be used."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to ignore config-specific flag "

"built-in defaults for the current compiler and platform."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.7.  Unlike most policies, "
"CMake version |release| does *not* warn by default when this policy is not "
"set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.  See documentation of the :variable:"
"`CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0066 <CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP<NNNN>>` variable to "
"control the warning."
