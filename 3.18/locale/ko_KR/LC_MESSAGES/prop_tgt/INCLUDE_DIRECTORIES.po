"This property specifies the list of directories given so far to the :command:"
"`target_include_directories` command.  In addition to accepting values from "
"that command, values may be set directly on any target using the :command:"

"from the value of the :prop_dir:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` directory property.  "
"Both directory and target property values are adjusted by calls to the :"
