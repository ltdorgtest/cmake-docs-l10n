"``VERSION`` arguments' ``<min>...<max>`` syntax. This requires only the "
"``<min>`` version of CMake, but when running a newer version, sets policies "
"up to the ``<max>`` version."

"On macOS with :ref:`Ninja Generators` and :ref:`Makefile Generators`, when a "
"compiler is found in ``/usr/bin``, it is now used as-is and is no longer "
"mapped to the corresponding compiler inside Xcode.  The mapping was "
"introduced by CMake 3.2 to allow build trees to continue to work with their "
"original compiler even when ``xcode-select`` switches to a different Xcode "
"installation.  However, the compilers inside Xcode cannot be used without "
"explicit ``-isysroot`` flags and are therefore not suitable for passing to "
"arbitrary third-party build systems.  Furthermore, the mapping behavior can "
"override user-specified compiler paths.  Therefore, this behavior has been "
"reverted."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../release/4.0.rst:232
msgid ""
"Builds targeting macOS no longer choose any SDK or pass an ``-isysroot`` "
"flag to the compiler by default.  Instead, compilers are expected to choose "
"a default macOS SDK on their own.  In order to use a compiler that does not "
"do this, users must now specify :variable:`CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT` when "
"configuring their build, e.g., ``-DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=macosx``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../release/4.0.rst:238
msgid ""
"Note that Xcode's compilers, when not invoked with ``-isysroot``, search for "
"headers in ``/usr/local/include`` before system SDK paths, matching the "
"convention on many platforms.  Users on macOS-x86_64 hosts with Homebrew "
"installed in ``/usr/local`` should pass ``-DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=macosx``, or "
"``export SDKROOT=macosx``, when not building with Homebrew tools."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../release/4.0.rst:244
msgid ""
"On Windows, file paths named in project code, e.g., in ``CMakeLists.txt``, "
"are no longer automatically converted to their on-disk upper/lower case. "
"Projects are expected to spell source file paths consistently using their "
"canonical case, e.g., in calls to :command:`add_library`, :command:"
"`set_property(SOURCE)`, or :command:`set_source_files_properties`. This "
"matches the behavior on platforms with case-sensitive filesystems."

"The :option:`cmake --preset` command no longer outputs a summary of the "
