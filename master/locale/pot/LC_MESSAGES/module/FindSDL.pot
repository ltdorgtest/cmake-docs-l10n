"This module is specifically intended for SDL version 1.  Starting with "
"version 2, SDL provides a CMake package configuration file when built with "
"CMake and should be found using ``find_package(SDL2)``.  Similarly, SDL "
"version 3 can be found using ``find_package(SDL3)``.  These newer versions "
"provide separate :ref:`Imported Targets` that encapsulate usage "
"requirements.  Refer to the official SDL documentation for more information."

"Note that the include path for the SDL header has changed in recent SDL 1 "
"versions from ``SDL/SDL.h`` to simply ``SDL.h``.  This change aligns with "
"SDL's convention of using ``#include \"SDL.h\"`` for portability, as not all "
"systems install the headers in a ``SDL/`` subdirectory (e.g., FreeBSD)."

"``SDLmain`` library is typically linked using ``-lSDLmain``, which this "
"module will attempt to locate automatically.  Additionally, for macOS, this "
"module will add the ``-framework Cocoa`` flag as needed."
