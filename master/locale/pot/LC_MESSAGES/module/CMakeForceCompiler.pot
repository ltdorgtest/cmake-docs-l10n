"The commands provided by this module were once intended for use by cross-"
"compiling toolchain files when CMake was not able to automatically detect "
"the compiler identification.  Since the introduction of this module, CMake's "
"compiler identification capabilities have improved and can now be taught to "
"recognize any compiler.  Furthermore, the suite of information CMake detects "
"from a compiler is now too extensive to be provided by toolchain files using "
"these macros."

"One common use case for this module was to skip CMake's checks for a working "
"compiler when using a cross-compiler that cannot link binaries without "
"special flags or custom linker scripts.  This case is now supported by "
"setting the :variable:`CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE` variable in the "
"toolchain file instead."
