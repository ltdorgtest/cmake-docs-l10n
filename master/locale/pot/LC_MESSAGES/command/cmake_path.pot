"This command is for the manipulation of paths.  Only syntactic aspects of "
"paths are handled, there is no interaction of any kind with any underlying "
"file system.  The path may represent a non-existing path or even one that is "
"not allowed to exist on the current file system or platform. For operations "
"that do interact with the filesystem, see the :command:`file` command."

"The ``cmake_path`` command handles paths in the format of the build system "
"(i.e. the host platform), not the target system.  When cross-compiling, if "
"the path contains elements that are not representable on the host platform "
"(e.g. a drive letter when the host is not Windows), the results will be "
"unpredictable."
