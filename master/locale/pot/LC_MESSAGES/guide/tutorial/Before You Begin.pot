"The CMake tutorial consists of hands-on exercises writing and building a C++ "

"The most obvious way to get your hands on CMake is to download it from the "

"However, it is preferable to acquire CMake via the usual delivery mechanism "
"for developer tools on your platform. CMake is available in most packaging "
"repositories, as a Visual Studio component, and can even be installed from "
"the Python package index. Additionally, CMake is often available as part of "
"the base image of most CI/CD runners targeting C/C++. You should consult the "

"available."

"CMake is a configuration program, sometimes called a \"meta\" build system. "
"As with other configuration systems, CMake is not ultimately responsible for "
"running the commands which produce the software build. Instead, CMake "
"generates a build system based on project, environment, and user-provided "
"configuration information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../guide/tutorial/Before You Begin.rst:74
msgid ""
"CMake supports multiple build systems as the output of this configuration "
"process. These output backends are called \"generators\", because they "
"generate the build system. CMake supports many generators, the documentation "
"for which can be found at :manual:`cmake-generators(7)`. Information about "
"supported generators for your particular CMake installation can be found "
"via :option:`cmake --help` under the \"Generators\" heading."
msgstr ""

"Using CMake thus requires one of the build programs which consumes this "

"``Visual Studio`` installation respectively."

"In many cases, it is possible to treat the underlying build system as an "
"implementation detail and not differentiate between, for example, ``ninja`` "
"and ``make`` when using CMake. However, there is one significant property of "
"a given generator which we need to be aware of for even trivial workflows: "
"if the generator supports single configuration builds, or if it supports "
"multi-configuration builds."

"Software builds often have several variants which we might be interested in. "

"A single-configuration build system always builds the software the same way, "
