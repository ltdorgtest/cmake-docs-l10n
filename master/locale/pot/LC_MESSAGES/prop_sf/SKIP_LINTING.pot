"This property allows you to exclude a specific source file from the linting "
"process. The linting process involves running tools such as :prop_tgt:"
"`<LANG>_CPPLINT`, :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY`, :prop_tgt:"
"`<LANG>_CPPCHECK`, and :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE` on the source "
"files, as well as compiling header files as part of :prop_tgt:"
"`VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS`. By setting ``SKIP_LINTING`` on a source "
"file, the mentioned linting tools will not be executed for that particular "

"Consider a C++ project that includes multiple source files, such as ``main."
"cpp``, ``things.cpp``, and ``generatedBindings.cpp``. In this example, you "
"want to exclude the ``generatedBindings.cpp`` file from the linting process. "
"To achieve this, you can utilize the ``SKIP_LINTING`` property with the :"
"command:`set_source_files_properties` command as shown below:"

"In the provided code snippet, the ``SKIP_LINTING`` property is set to true "

"By using the ``SKIP_LINTING`` property, you can selectively exclude specific "
