"No collision resistance within a target is performed by CMake. When using "
"this property, collisions must be avoided in the project code. CMake has a "
"number of source files it generates that also create object files that may "
"collide with a given custom name. These include: * Generated PCH source "
"files (``cmake_pch``) * Generated Unity compilation files (``unity_``) * Qt "
"autogen sources (``moc_compilations.cpp``)"
