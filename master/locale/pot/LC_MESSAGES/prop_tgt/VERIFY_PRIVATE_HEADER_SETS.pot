"When this property is set to true, and the target is an object library, "
"static library, shared library, module library, interface library, or "
"executable, and the target has one or more ``PUBLIC`` or ``PRIVATE`` header "
"sets, an object library target named "

"target has one source file per header in the ``PUBLIC`` and ``PRIVATE`` "
"header sets. Each source file only includes its associated header file."

"Properties affecting compilation are copied from the original target to the "
"verification target so that the headers will be interpreted the same way by "
"the compiler as when compiling the original target's sources.  There are "
"some caveats with this approach.  It cannot replicate the same conditions if "
"any of those properties or properties inherited through build requirements "
"from transitive dependencies contain :ref:`target-dependent generator "
"expressions <Target-Dependent Expressions>` that do not specify the target "
"for the expansion.  Such expressions can expand to different contents "
"depending on the target they are being used on."

"If the header's :prop_sf:`LANGUAGE` property is set, the value of that "
