"When installing object files, CMake automatically adds ``objects[-<CONFIG>]/"
"<TARGET_NAME>`` components to the destination to avoid conflicts. Use this "
"property to suppress these components. Note that when using a single install "
"prefix for multiple configurations (whether via multi-config generators or "
"separate build trees), the destination must use ``$<CONFIG>`` to avoid "
"conflicts. Alternatively, the :prop_sf:`INSTALL_OBJECT_NAME` may be used to "
"avoid configuration-based conflicts."
