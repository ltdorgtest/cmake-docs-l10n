"The ``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` target property determines whether "
"position-independent executables or libraries will be created.  This "
"property is ``True`` by default for ``SHARED`` and ``MODULE`` library "
"targets.  For other targets, this property is initialized by the value of "
"the :variable:`CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` variable if it is set when "
"the target is created, or ``False`` otherwise."

msgid ""
"Position-independent code (PIC) refers to machine code that executes "
"properly regardless of its absolute memory address.  This is particularly "
"important for shared libraries, which are often loaded at different memory "
"addresses by different programs.  Generating position-independent code "
"ensures that these libraries can be safely and efficiently shared among "
"multiple processes without causing address conflicts.  On some platforms "
"(notably UNIX-like systems), generating PIC is also a requirement for "
"creating shared libraries."
