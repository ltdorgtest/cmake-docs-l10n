"static library, shared library, interface library, or executable (subject to "
"policy :policy:`CMP0209`) and the target has one or more ``PUBLIC`` or "
"``INTERFACE`` header sets, an object library target named "
"``<target_name>_verify_interface_header_sets`` is created. This verification "
"target has one source file per header in the ``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` "
"header sets. Each source file only includes its associated header file. The "
"verification target links against the original target to get all of its "
"usage requirements."
