"When this property is set to true, some dependencies for a static or object "
"library may be removed at generation time if they are not necessary to build "
"the library, since static and object libraries don't actually link against "
"anything."

"If a static or object library has dependency optimization enabled, it first "
"discards all dependencies. Then, it looks through all of the direct and "
"indirect dependencies that it initially had, and adds them back if they meet "
"any of the following criteria:"

"The dependency contains any source files that were generated by a custom "
"command. However, if :policy:`CMP0154` is ``NEW`` for the dependency and it "
"uses :ref:`File Sets`, only source files that are scoped as ``PUBLIC``, "
"``INTERFACE``, or of type ``CXX_MODULES`` are considered."

"The dependency contains any languages which produce side effects that are "
"relevant to the library. Currently, all languages except C, C++, Objective-"
"C, Objective-C++, assembly, and CUDA are assumed to produce side effects. "
"However, side effects from one language are assumed not to be relevant to "
"another (for example, a Fortran library is assumed to not have any side "
"effects that are relevant for a Swift library)."

"As an example, assume you have a static Fortran library which depends on a "
"static C library, which in turn depends on a static Fortran library. The top-"
"level Fortran library has optimization enabled, but the middle C library "
"does not. If you build the top Fortran library, the bottom Fortran library "
"will also build, but not the middle C library, since the C library does not "
"have any side effects that are relevant for the Fortran library. However, if "
"you build the middle C library, the bottom Fortran library will also build, "
"even though it does not have any side effects that are relevant to the C "
"library, since the C library does not have optimization enabled."
