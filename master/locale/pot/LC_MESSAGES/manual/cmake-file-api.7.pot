"CMake provides a file-based API that clients may use to get semantic "
"information about the buildsystems CMake generates.  Clients may use the API "
"by writing query files to a specific location in a build tree to request "
"zero or more `Object Kinds`_.  When CMake generates the buildsystem in that "
"build tree it will read the query files and write reply files for the client "
"to read."
