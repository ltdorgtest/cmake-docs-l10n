"The :command:`file(CREATE_LINK)` command's ``COPY_ON_ERROR`` option copies "
"the source file to the destination as a fallback if linking it fails. If the "
"source is a directory, CMake 4.2 and below create the destination directory "
"but do not copy its contents.  CMake 4.3 and above prefer to copy the "
"directory contents too.  This policy provides compatibility with projects "
"that have not been updated to expect the contents to be copied."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to create the destination directory "
"without copying contents.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy to create "
"the destination directory and copy contents from the source directory."

"It may be set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:"
