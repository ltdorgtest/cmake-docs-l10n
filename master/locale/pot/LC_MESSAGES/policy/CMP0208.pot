"empty or missing values."

"CMake 4.3 and above issue a diagnostic if any of these keywords are present "
"without an associated value, or of the value given to ``FILE`` or "
"``CXX_MODULES_DIRECTORY`` is empty.  (``NAMESPACE`` is allowed to have an "
"empty value, but an empty value must be quoted.)  A diagnostic is also "
"issued immediately if the value of ``EXPORT`` is missing or empty.  "
"(Previously, this would result in an error at generate-time because no "
"export set whose name is empty can exist.)"

"This policy provides compatibility with projects which may have relied on "
"the previous lack of enforcement.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy "
"permits these keywords to be present without an accompanying value, or to be "
"given an empty value.  The ``NEW`` behavior requires that a value be given, "
"and that the value (except for ``NAMESPACE``) is non-empty."

"It may be set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:"

"and uses ``OLD`` behavior."
