"In CMake 4.1 and below, :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` compile sources in "
"shared libraries with ``_WINDLL`` defined due to behavior of Visual Studio "
"itself.  The preprocessor definition is not modeled by CMake and is "
"therefore not added by other generators, such as :generator:`Ninja`."

"CMake 4.2 and above, when targeting the MSVC ABI, prefer to compile sources "
"in shared libraries with ``_WINDLL`` defined by all generators. This policy "
"provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated to be aware "
"of the definition.  Its setting is recorded by each target as it is created, "
"and affects compilation of sources in that target."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy does not model the ``_WINDLL`` "

"libraries when targeting the MSVC ABI."
