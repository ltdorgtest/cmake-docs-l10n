":module:`GNUInstallDirs` caches ``CMAKE_INSTALL_*`` with leading ``usr/`` "

"When :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is ``/``, the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>`` "
"variables, for ``<dir>`` equal to ``BINDIR``, ``SBINDIR``, ``LIBEXECDIR``, "
"``SHAREDSTATEDIR``, ``INCLUDEDIR``, ``OLDINCLUDEDIR``, ``DATAROOTDIR``, and "
"``LIBDIR``, are prepended with a leading ``usr/`` as documented among the :"
"ref:`special cases <GNUInstallDirs special cases>`. In CMake 4.0 and below, "
"these ``CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>`` variables were cached without their leading "
"``usr/``, and it was prepended in normal variables that shadow their cache "
"entries. CMake 4.1 and above prefer to cache ``CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>`` with "
"their leading ``usr/``.  Consequently, the :command:"
"`GNUInstallDirs_get_absolute_install_dir` command no longer alters the "
"relative ``var`` input variable.  This policy provides compatibility for "
"projects that have not been updated to expect the new behavior."
