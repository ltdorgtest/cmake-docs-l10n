"In CMake 4.2 and below, the :cpack_gen:`CPack Archive Generator` always used "
"the current user's UID/GID in archive entries.  CMake 4.3 added the :"
"variable:`CPACK_ARCHIVE_UID` and :variable:`CPACK_ARCHIVE_GID` variables to "
"control them.  If either is set, the default for the other is ``0``. If "
"neither is set, CMake 4.3 and above prefer to default both UID and GID to "
"``0`` so that unpacking by ``root`` produces paths owned by ``root``. This "
"policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated to "
"expect the new behavior."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to produce archive entries with the "

"to produce archive entries with the UID/GID set to 0/0 by default."
