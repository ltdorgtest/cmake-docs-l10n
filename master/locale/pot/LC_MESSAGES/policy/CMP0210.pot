"In CMake 4.2 and below, :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_FLAGS` held flags "
"relevant to target creation and applied when linking executables only. It "
"was undocumented and originally intended for internal use only, but still "
"available for projects and users to set in order to control linking behavior."

"CMake 4.3 and above repurpose this variable to add per-language link flags "
"for all target types that link (executables, shared libraries, and module "
"libraries)."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to apply :variable:"
