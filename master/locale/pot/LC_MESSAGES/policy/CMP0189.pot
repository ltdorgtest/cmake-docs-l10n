"The :prop_tgt:`LINK_LIBRARIES` and :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` "
"target properties record link dependencies through which the :genex:"
"`TARGET_PROPERTY` generator expression evaluates transitive properties. "
"However, in CMake 4.0 and below, the properties themselves were not "
"evaluated transitively.  CMake 4.1 and above prefer to evaluate the :"
"prop_tgt:`LINK_LIBRARIES` and :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` target "
"properties transitively because they are among the :ref:`build specification "
"<Target Build Specification>` and :ref:`usage requirement <Target Usage "
"Requirements>` properties, respectively."

"This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated "
"to expect the new behavior.  It takes effect during buildsystem generation. "
"Generator expressions are evaluated in each directory using the policy "
"setting as of the end of its ``CMakeLists.txt``.  As an exception, generator "
"expressions evaluated by the :command:`file(GENERATE)` command use the "
"policy setting as of its call site."
