"When :prop_tgt:`VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS` is set to true on an "
"executable target, CMake 4.2 and below would only perform those checks if "
"the target's :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` property was true.  The reasoning "
"behind this exclusion was that no other target could consume the headers of "
"an executable target if that executable target didn't export symbols.  Since "
"then, other use cases have emerged for verifying header file sets where "
"exporting symbols is no longer a requirement.  Therefore, CMake 4.3 and "
"above prefer to verify interface file sets of executable targets regardless "
"of whether they export symbols or not."

"executable target if its :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` property is set to true. "
"The ``NEW`` behavior always verifies interface file sets of an executable "
"target when :prop_tgt:`VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS` is set to true."
