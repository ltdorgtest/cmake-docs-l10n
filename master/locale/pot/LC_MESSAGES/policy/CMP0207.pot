"The :command:`file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)` and :command:"
"`install(RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY_SET)` commands support filtering resolved "
"dependencies using regular expressions matching their paths. In CMake 4.2 "
"and below, callers were responsible for matching both forward and backward "
"slashes as path separators on Windows, e.g., via ``[\\/]``. CMake 4.3 and "
"above prefer to normalize paths to use forward slashes before matching.  "
"This policy provides compaitiblity for projects that may have been relying "
"on matching backslashes only."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy matches filters against paths that may "
"contain any combination of forward and backward slashes on Windows. The "
"``NEW`` behavior for this policy to convert all paths to forward slashes "
"before matching filters."
