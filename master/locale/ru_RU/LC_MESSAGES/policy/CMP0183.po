"The ``<enabled>`` parameter accepts a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake "
"Language Lists>` of conditions.  CMake 3.31 and lower evaluate each "
"``condition`` as ``if(${condition})``, which does not properly handle "
"conditions with nested paren groups.  CMake 4.0 and above instead prefer to "
"evaluate each ``condition`` as ``if(<condition>)``, where ``<condition>`` is "
"re-parsed as if literally written in a call to :command:`if`.  This allows "
"expressions like::"
