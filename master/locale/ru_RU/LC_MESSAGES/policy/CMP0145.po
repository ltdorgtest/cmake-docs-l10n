"These modules were added very early in CMake's development to support "
"driving tests with a \"DART\" tool, but DART has not been distributed or "
"maintained for many years.  Projects would ``include(Dart)`` to use it, and "
"the ``Dart`` module would run ``find_package(Dart)`` internally. Since :"
"manual:`ctest(1)` was created, the ``Dart`` module has just been a "
"compatibility shim that finds ``Dart`` to support some legacy functionality "
"and then forwards to the :module:`CTest` module."

"CMake 3.27 and above prefer to not provide the :module:`Dart` or :module:"
"`FindDart` modules.  This policy provides compatibility for projects that "
"have not been ported away from them.  Projects using the ``Dart`` module "
"should be updated to use the :module:`CTest` module directly."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for ``include(Dart)`` and "

"is for uses of the modules to fail as if they do not exist."
