"In CMake versions 2.6.4 and lower the :command:`if` command implicitly "
"dereferenced arguments corresponding to variables, even those named like "
"numbers or boolean constants, except for ``0`` and ``1``.  Numbers and "
"boolean constants such as ``true``, ``false``, ``yes``, ``no``, ``on``, "
"``off``, ``y``, ``n``, ``notfound``, ``ignore`` (all case insensitive) were "
"recognized in some cases but not all.  For example, the code ``if(TRUE)`` "
"might have evaluated as ``false``. Numbers such as 2 were recognized only in "
"boolean expressions like ``if(NOT 2)`` (leading to ``false``) but not as a "
"single-argument like ``if(2)`` (also leading to ``false``).  Later versions "
"of CMake prefer to treat numbers and boolean constants literally, so they "
"should not be used as variable names."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to implicitly dereference variables "

"This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. "
"Prior to removal in CMake version |REMOVED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|, it could be "
"set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:`cmake_minimum_required`. If it "
"was not set, CMake |WARNED_OR_DID_NOT_WARN|, and used ``OLD`` behavior."
