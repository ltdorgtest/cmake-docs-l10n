"Turn off compile batching for the target. Usually MSBuild calls the compiler "
"with multiple c/cpp files and compiler starts subprocesses for each file to "
"make the build parallel. If you want compiler to be invoked with one file at "
"a time set ``VS_NO_COMPILE_BATCHING`` to ON. If this flag is set MSBuild "
"will call compiler with one c/cpp file at a time. Useful when you want to "
"use tool that replaces the compiler, for example some build caching tool."
