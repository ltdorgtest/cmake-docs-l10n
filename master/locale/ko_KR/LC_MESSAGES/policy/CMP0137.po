"The :command:`try_compile` command :ref:`source file <Try Compiling Source "
"Files>` signature propagates CMake variables containing platform settings, "
"and those specified by the :variable:`CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_PLATFORM_VARIABLES` "
"variable, into the generated test project.  This helps the test project "
"drive the toolchain the same way the calling project will.  In CMake 3.23 "
"and below, the :ref:`whole-project <Try Compiling Whole Projects>` signature "
"does not propagate platform variables automatically.  CMake 3.24 and above "
"prefer to propagate platform variables in the :ref:`whole-project <Try "
"Compiling Whole Projects>` signature.  This policy provides compatibility "
"with projects that have not been updated to expect the behavior."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to not pass any additional variables "
"to the :ref:`whole-project <Try Compiling Whole Projects>` signature. The "
"``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to pass the same variables that the :ref:"
"`source file <Try Compiling Source Files>` signature does."
