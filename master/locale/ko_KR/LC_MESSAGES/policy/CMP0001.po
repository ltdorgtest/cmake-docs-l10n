"In CMake 2.4 and below the variable ``CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY`` was "
"used to request compatibility with earlier versions of CMake.  In CMake 2.6 "
"and above all compatibility issues are handled by policies and the :command:"
"`cmake_policy` command.  However, CMake must still check "
"``CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY`` for projects written for CMake 2.4 and "
"below."

"set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:`cmake_minimum_required`. If it "
"was not set, CMake |WARNED_OR_DID_NOT_WARN|, and used ``OLD`` behavior."
