"CMake 2.8.11 constructed the 'link interface' of a target from properties "
"matching ``(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)?``. The modern "
"way to specify config-sensitive content is to use generator expressions and "
"the ``IMPORTED_`` prefix makes uniform processing of the link interface with "
"generator expressions impossible.  The :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` "
"target property was introduced as a replacement in CMake 2.8.12.  This new "
"property is named consistently with the ``INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS``, "
"``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` and ``INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS`` "
"properties.  For in-build targets, CMake will use the "
"INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property as the source of the link interface only "
"if policy ``CMP0022`` is ``NEW``.  When exporting a target which has this "
"policy set to ``NEW``, only the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` "
"property will be processed and generated for the ``IMPORTED`` target by "
"default.  A new option to the :command:`install(EXPORT)` and export commands "
"allows export of the old-style properties for compatibility with downstream "
"users of CMake versions older than 2.8.12.  The :command:"
"`target_link_libraries` command will no longer populate the properties "
"matching ``LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)?`` if this policy is ``NEW``."
