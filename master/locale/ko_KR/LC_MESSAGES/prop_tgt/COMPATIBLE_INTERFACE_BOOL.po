"The ``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL`` property may contain a list of properties "
"for this target which must be consistent when evaluated as a boolean with "
"the ``INTERFACE`` variant of the property in all linked dependees.  For "
"example, if a property ``FOO`` appears in the list, then for each dependee, "
"the ``INTERFACE_FOO`` property content in all of its dependencies must be "
"consistent with each other, and with the ``FOO`` property in the depender."

"Consistency in this sense has the meaning that if the property is set, then "
"it must have the same boolean value as all others, and if the property is "
"not set, then it is ignored."
