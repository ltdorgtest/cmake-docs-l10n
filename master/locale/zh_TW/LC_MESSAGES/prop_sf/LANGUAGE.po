"A property that can be set to indicate what programming language the source "
"file is.  If it is not set the language is determined based on the file "
"extension.  Typical values are ``CXX`` (i.e.  C++), ``C``, ``CSharp``, "
"``CUDA``, ``Fortran``, ``HIP``, ``ISPC``, and ``ASM``.  Setting this "
"property for a file means this file will be compiled, unless :prop_sf:"
"`HEADER_FILE_ONLY` is set."

"Setting this property causes the source file to be compiled as the specified "
"language, using explicit flags if possible.  Previously it only caused the "
"specified language's compiler to be used. See policy :policy:`CMP0119`."
