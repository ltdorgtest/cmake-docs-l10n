"CMake 2.8.10 and lower required users of Qt to always specify a link "
"dependency to the ``qtmain.lib`` static library manually on Windows. CMake "
"2.8.11 gained the ability to evaluate generator expressions while "
"determining the link dependencies from ``IMPORTED`` targets.  This allows "
"CMake itself to automatically link executables which link to Qt to the "
"``qtmain.lib`` library when using ``IMPORTED`` Qt targets.  For applications "
"already linking to ``qtmain.lib``, this should have little impact.  For "
"applications which supply their own alternative WinMain implementation and "
"for applications which use the QAxServer library, this automatic linking "
"will need to be disabled as per the documentation."
