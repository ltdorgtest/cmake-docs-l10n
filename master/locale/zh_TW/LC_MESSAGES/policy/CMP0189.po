"The :prop_tgt:`LINK_LIBRARIES` and :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` "
"target properties record link dependencies through which the :genex:"
"`TARGET_PROPERTY` generator expression evaluates transitive properties. "
"However, in CMake 4.0 and below, the properties themselves were not "
"evaluated transitively.  CMake 4.1 and above prefer to evaluate the :"
"prop_tgt:`LINK_LIBRARIES` and :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` target "
"properties transitively because they are among the :ref:`build specification "
"<Target Build Specification>` and :ref:`usage requirement <Target Usage "
"Requirements>` properties, respectively. This policy provides compatibility "
"for projects that have not been updated to expect the new behavior."
