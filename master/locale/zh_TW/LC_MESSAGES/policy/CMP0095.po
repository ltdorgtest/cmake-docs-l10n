"In CMake 3.15 and earlier, ``RPATH`` entries set via :variable:"
"`CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH` or via :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_RPATH` have not been escaped "
"before being inserted into the ``cmake_install.cmake`` script. Dynamic "
"linkers on ELF-based systems (e.g. Linux and FreeBSD) allow certain keywords "
"in ``RPATH`` entries, such as ``${ORIGIN}`` (More details are available in "
"the ``ld.so`` man pages on those systems). The syntax of these keywords can "
"match CMake's variable syntax. In order to not be substituted (usually to an "
"empty string) already by the intermediary ``cmake_install.cmake`` script, "
"the user had to double-escape such ``RPATH`` keywords, e.g. "
"``set(CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH \"\\\\\\${ORIGIN}/../lib\")``. Since the "
"intermediary ``cmake_install.cmake`` script is an implementation detail of "
"CMake, CMake 3.16 and later will make sure ``RPATH`` entries are inserted "
"literally by escaping any coincidental CMake syntax."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to not escape ``RPATH`` entries in "
"the intermediary ``cmake_install.cmake`` script. The ``NEW`` behavior is to "
"properly escape coincidental CMake syntax in ``RPATH`` entries when "
"generating the intermediary ``cmake_install.cmake`` script."
