"This command was added in June 2001 to expose the then-current CMake "
"implicit dependency scanner.  CMake's real implicit dependency scanner has "
"evolved since then but is not exposed through this command.  The scanning "
"capabilities of this command are very limited and this functionality is "
"better achieved through dedicated outside tools."

"CMake >= |disallowed_version| prefer that this command never be called. The "
"``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow the command to be called. The "
"``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to issue a ``FATAL_ERROR`` when the "
"command is called."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. "
"Prior to removal in CMake version |REMOVED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|, it could be "
"set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:`cmake_minimum_required`. If it "
"was not set, CMake |WARNED_OR_DID_NOT_WARN|, and used ``OLD`` behavior."
