"and so on. However, it is strongly recommended to stay with the case chosen "

msgid ""
"When a macro is invoked, the commands recorded in the macro are first "
"modified by replacing formal parameters (``${arg1}``, ...) with the "
"arguments passed, and then invoked as normal commands."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../command/macro.rst:62
msgid ""
"In addition to referencing the formal parameters you can reference the "
"values ``${ARGC}`` which will be set to the number of arguments passed into "
"the macro as well as ``${ARGV0}``, ``${ARGV1}``, ``${ARGV2}``, ...  which "
"will have the actual values of the arguments passed in. This facilitates "
"creating macros with optional arguments."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../command/macro.rst:68
msgid ""
"Furthermore, ``${ARGV}`` holds the list of all arguments given to the macro "
"and ``${ARGN}`` holds the list of arguments past the last expected argument. "
"Referencing to ``${ARGV#}`` arguments beyond ``${ARGC}`` have undefined "
"behavior. Checking that ``${ARGC}`` is greater than ``#`` is the only way to "
"ensure that ``${ARGV#}`` was passed to the function as an extra argument."

msgid "Macro vs Function"

msgid ""
"The ``macro`` command is very similar to the :command:`function` command. "
"Nonetheless, there are a few important differences."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../command/macro.rst:84
msgid ""
"In a function, ``ARGN``, ``ARGC``, ``ARGV`` and ``ARGV0``, ``ARGV1``, ... "
"are true variables in the usual CMake sense.  In a macro, they are not, they "
"are string replacements much like the C preprocessor would do with a macro.  "
"This has a number of consequences, as explained in the :ref:`Argument "
"Caveats` section below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../command/macro.rst:90
msgid ""
"Another difference between macros and functions is the control flow. A "
"function is executed by transferring control from the calling statement to "
"the function body.  A macro is executed as if the macro body were pasted in "
"place of the calling statement.  This has the consequence that a :command:"
"`return()` in a macro body does not just terminate execution of the macro; "
"rather, control is returned from the scope of the macro call.  To avoid "
"confusion, it is recommended to avoid :command:`return()` in macros "
"altogether."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../command/macro.rst:99

"Unlike a function, the :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION`, :variable:"
"`CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR`, :variable:"
"`CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_FILE`, :variable:"
"`CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_LINE` variables are not set for a macro."

#: ../../../command/macro.rst:110
msgid ""
"Since ``ARGN``, ``ARGC``, ``ARGV``, ``ARGV0`` etc. are not variables, you "

"if(ARGV1) # ARGV1 is not a variable\n"

"foreach(loop_var IN LISTS ARGN) # ARGN is not a variable"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../command/macro.rst:120
msgid ""
"In the first case, you can use ``if(${ARGV1})``.  In the second and third "
"case, the proper way to check if an optional variable was passed to the "
"macro is to use ``if(${ARGC} GREATER 2)``.  In the last case, you can use "
"``foreach(loop_var ${ARGN})`` but this will skip empty arguments.  If you "
"need to include them, you can use"

"Note that if you have a variable with the same name in the scope from which "
