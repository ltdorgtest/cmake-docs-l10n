"CMake loads the specified file while enabling support for each language from "
"either the :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language` commands.  It is "
"loaded after CMake's builtin compiler and platform information modules have "
"been loaded but before the information is used.  The file may set platform "
"information variables to override CMake's defaults. See :variable:"
"`CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE_<LANG>` for the language-specific version of "
"this variable."

"This feature is intended for use only in overriding information variables "
"that must be set before CMake builds its first test project to check that "
"the compiler for a language works.  It should not be used to load a file in "
"cases that a normal :command:`include` will work.  Use it only as a last "
"resort for behavior that cannot be achieved any other way.  For example, one "
"may set the :variable:`CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_INIT>` "
"variable to change the default value used to initialize the :variable:"
"`CMAKE_C_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>` variable before it is cached.  The "
"override file should NOT be used to set anything that could be set after "
"languages are enabled, such as variables like :variable:"
"`CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` that affect the placement of binaries.  "
"Information set in the file will be used for :command:`try_compile` and :"
"command:`try_run` builds too."
