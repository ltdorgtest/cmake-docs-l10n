"Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries as part of their "
"implementation.  On some platforms the linker searches for the dependent "
"libraries of shared libraries they are including in the link.  Set this "
"property to the list of dependent shared libraries of an imported library.  "
"The list should be disjoint from the list of interface libraries in the :"
"prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` property.  On platforms requiring "
"dependent shared libraries to be found at link time CMake uses this list to "
"add appropriate files or paths to the link command line.  Ignored for non-"
"imported targets."
