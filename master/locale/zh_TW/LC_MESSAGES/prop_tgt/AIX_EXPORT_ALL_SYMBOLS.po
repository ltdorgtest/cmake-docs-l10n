"On AIX, CMake automatically exports all symbols from shared libraries, and "
"from executables with the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property set. "
"Explicitly disable this boolean property to suppress the behavior and export "
"no symbols by default.  In this case it is expected that the project will "
"use other means to export some symbols."
