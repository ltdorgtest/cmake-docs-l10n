"If the target contains Fortran source files that provide modules and the "
"compiler supports a module output directory this specifies the directory in "
"which the modules will be placed.  When this property is not set the modules "
"will be placed in the build directory corresponding to the target's source "
"directory.  If the variable :variable:`CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY` is "
"set when a target is created its value is used to initialize this property."

msgid ""
"When using one of the :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` with the Intel Fortran "
"plugin installed in Visual Studio, a subdirectory named after the "
"configuration will be appended to the path where modules are created. For "
"example, if ``Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY`` is set to ``C:/some/path``, modules "
"will end up in ``C:/some/path/Debug`` (or ``C:/some/path/Release`` etc.) "
"when an Intel Fortran ``.vfproj`` file is generated, and in ``C:/some/path`` "
"when any other generator is used."

"Note that some compilers will automatically search the module output "
"directory for modules USEd during compilation but others will not.  If your "
"sources USE modules their location must be specified by :prop_tgt:"
"`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` regardless of this property."
