"Both the :prop_test:`RESOURCE_GROUPS` and ``RESOURCE_LOCK`` properties serve "
"similar purposes, but they are distinct and orthogonal. Resources specified "
"by :prop_test:`RESOURCE_GROUPS` do not affect ``RESOURCE_LOCK``, and vice "
"versa. Whereas ``RESOURCE_LOCK`` is a simpler property that is used for "
"locking one global resource, :prop_test:`RESOURCE_GROUPS` is a more advanced "
"property that allows multiple tests to simultaneously use multiple resources "
"of the same type, specifying their requirements in a fine-grained manner."
