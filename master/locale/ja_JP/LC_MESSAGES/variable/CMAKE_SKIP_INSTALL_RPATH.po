"Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building executables "
"etc on systems that use RPATH.  When the software is installed the "
"executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the install RPATH.  If this "
"variable is set to true then the software is always installed without RPATH, "
"even if RPATH is enabled when building.  This can be useful for example to "
"allow running tests from the build directory with RPATH enabled before the "
"installation step."
