"The :command:`ctest_build` and :command:`build_command` commands no longer "
"generate build commands for :ref:`Makefile Generators` with the ``-i`` "
"option.  Previously this was done to help build as much of tested projects "
"as possible.  However, this behavior is not consistent with other generators "
"and also causes the return code of the ``make`` tool to be meaningless."

"was not set, CMake |WARNED_OR_DID_NOT_WARN|, and used ``OLD`` behavior."
