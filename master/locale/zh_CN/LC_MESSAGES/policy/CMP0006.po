"This policy determines whether the :command:`install(TARGETS)` command must "
"be given a ``BUNDLE DESTINATION`` when asked to install a target with the :"
"prop_tgt:`MACOSX_BUNDLE` property set.  CMake 2.4 and below did not "
"distinguish application bundles from normal executables when installing "
"targets. CMake 2.6 provides a ``BUNDLE`` option to the :command:"
"`install(TARGETS)` command that specifies rules specific to application "
"bundles on the Mac. Projects should use this option when installing a target "
"with the :prop_tgt:`MACOSX_BUNDLE` property set."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to fall back to the ``RUNTIME "
"DESTINATION`` if a ``BUNDLE DESTINATION`` is not given.  The ``NEW`` "
"behavior for this policy is to produce an error if a bundle target is "
"installed without a ``BUNDLE DESTINATION``."

"was not set, CMake |WARNED_OR_DID_NOT_WARN|, and used ``OLD`` behavior."
