"The ``<executable>`` is run in the optionally specified directory ``<working-"
"dir>``.  The executable can include arguments if it is double quoted, but it "
"is better to use the optional ``ARGS`` argument to specify arguments to the "
"executable program.  This is because CMake will then be able to escape "
"spaces in the executable path.  An optional argument ``OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` "
"specifies a variable in which to store the output.  To capture the return "
"value of the execution, provide a ``RETURN_VALUE``.  If ``OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` "
"is specified, then no output will go to the stdout/stderr of the console "
"running CMake."
