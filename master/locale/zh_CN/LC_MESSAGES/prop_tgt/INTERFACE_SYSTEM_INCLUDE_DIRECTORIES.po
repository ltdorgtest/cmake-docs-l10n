"Targets may populate this property to publish the include directories which "
"contain system headers, and therefore should not result in compiler "
"warnings.  Additionally, system include directories are searched after "
"normal include directories regardless of the order specified."

"When the :command:`target_include_directories` command is given the "
"``SYSTEM`` keyword, it populates this property with values provided after "
"the ``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` keywords."

"Projects may also get and set the property directly, but must be aware that "
"adding directories to this property does not make those directories used "
"during compilation.  Adding directories to this property marks directories "
"as system directories which otherwise would be used in a non-system manner. "
"This can appear similar to duplication, so prefer the high-level :command:"
"`target_include_directories` command with the ``SYSTEM`` keyword and avoid "
"setting the property directly."

"When target dependencies are specified using :command:"
"`target_link_libraries`, CMake will read this property from all target "
"dependencies to mark the same include directories as containing system "
"headers."
