"To generate the path prefix, CMake tests if the header compiled by ``moc`` "
"is in any of the target :command:`include directories "

"accordingly.  If the header is not in the :command:`include directories "
"<target_include_directories>`, CMake will omit the ``-p`` path prefix "
"option.  ``moc`` usually generates a relative include path in that case."
