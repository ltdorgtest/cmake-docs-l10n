"When :command:`find_package` loads a ``Find<PackageName>.cmake`` or "
"``<PackageName>Config.cmake`` module, the ``CMAKE_FIND_REQUIRED`` variable "
"is automatically unset within it to restore the default behavior for nested "
"find operations.  The module is free to set the ``CMAKE_FIND_REQUIRED`` "
"variable itself to opt-in to the behavior."
