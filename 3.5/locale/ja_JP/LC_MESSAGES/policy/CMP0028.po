"The use of double-colons is a common pattern used to namespace IMPORTED "
"targets and ALIAS targets.  When computing the link dependencies of a "
"target, the name of each dependency could either be a target, or a file on "
"disk. Previously, if a target was not found with a matching name, the name "
"was considered to refer to a file on disk.  This can lead to confusing error "
"messages if there is a typo in what should be a target name."

"The OLD behavior for this policy is to search for targets, then files on "
"disk, even if the search term contains double-colons.  The NEW behavior for "
"this policy is to issue a FATAL_ERROR if a link dependency contains double-"
"colons but is not an IMPORTED target or an ALIAS target."
