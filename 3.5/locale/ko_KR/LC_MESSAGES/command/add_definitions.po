"Adds definitions to the compiler command line for targets in the current "
"directory and below (whether added before or after this command is invoked). "
"This command can be used to add any flags, but it is intended to add "
"preprocessor definitions (see the :command:`add_compile_options` command to "
"add other flags). Flags beginning in -D or /D that look like preprocessor "
"definitions are automatically added to the :prop_dir:`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` "
"directory property for the current directory.  Definitions with non-trivial "
"values may be left in the set of flags instead of being converted for "
"reasons of backwards compatibility.  See documentation of the :prop_dir:"
"`directory <COMPILE_DEFINITIONS>`, :prop_tgt:`target "
"<COMPILE_DEFINITIONS>`, :prop_sf:`source file <COMPILE_DEFINITIONS>` "
"``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` properties for details on adding preprocessor "
"definitions to specific scopes and configurations."
