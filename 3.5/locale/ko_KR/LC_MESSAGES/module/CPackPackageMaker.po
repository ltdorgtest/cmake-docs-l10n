"The version of Mac OS X that the resulting PackageMaker archive should be "
"compatible with. Different versions of Mac OS X support different features. "
"For example, CPack can only build component-based installers for Mac OS X "
"10.4 or newer, and can only build installers that download component son-the-"
"fly for Mac OS X 10.5 or newer. If left blank, this value will be set to the "
"minimum version of Mac OS X that supports the requested features. Set this "
"variable to some value (e.g., 10.4) only if you want to guarantee that your "
"installer will work on that version of Mac OS X, and don't mind missing "
"extra features available in the installer shipping with later versions of "
"Mac OS X."
