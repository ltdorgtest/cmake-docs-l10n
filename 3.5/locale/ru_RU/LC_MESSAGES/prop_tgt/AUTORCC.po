"``AUTORCC`` is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle the Qt ``rcc`` "
"code generator automatically, i.e. without having to use the :module:"
"`QT4_ADD_RESOURCES() <FindQt4>` or ``QT5_ADD_RESOURCES()`` macro.  Currently "
"Qt4 and Qt5 are supported."

"When this property is ``ON``, CMake will handle ``.qrc`` files added as "
"target sources at build time and invoke ``rcc`` accordingly. This property "
"is initialized by the value of the :variable:`CMAKE_AUTORCC` variable if it "
"is set when a target is created."
