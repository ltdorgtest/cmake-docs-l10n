"For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to specify the build "
"version and API version respectively.  When building or installing "
"appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports symlinks and the "
"linker supports so-names.  If only one of both is specified the missing is "
"assumed to have the same version number.  For executables VERSION can be "
"used to specify the build version.  When building or installing appropriate "
"symlinks are created if the platform supports symlinks.  For shared "
"libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION attribute is parsed to "
"extract a \"major.minor\" version number.  These numbers are used as the "
"image version of the binary."
