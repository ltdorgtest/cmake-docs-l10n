"This macro takes a library base name as an argument, and will choose good "
"values for basename_LIBRARY, basename_LIBRARIES, basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG, and "
"basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE depending on what has been found and set.  If only "
"basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE is defined, basename_LIBRARY will be set to the "
"release value, and basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG will be set to "
"basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG-NOTFOUND. If only basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG is defined, "
"then basename_LIBRARY will take the debug value, and "
"basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE will be set to basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE-NOTFOUND."

"If the generator supports configuration types, then basename_LIBRARY and "
"basename_LIBRARIES will be set with debug and optimized flags specifying the "
"library to be used for the given configuration.  If no build type has been "
"set or the generator in use does not support configuration types, then "
"basename_LIBRARY and basename_LIBRARIES will take only the release value, or "
"the debug value if the release one is not set."
