"Adds a target with the given name that executes the given commands. The "
"target has no output file and is ALWAYS CONSIDERED OUT OF DATE even if the "
"commands try to create a file with the name of the target. Use "
"ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND to generate a file with dependencies.  By default nothing "
"depends on the custom target.  Use ADD_DEPENDENCIES to add dependencies to "
"or from other targets.  If the ALL option is specified it indicates that "
"this target should be added to the default build target so that it will be "
"run every time (the command cannot be called ALL).  The command and "
"arguments are optional and if not specified an empty target will be "
"created.  If WORKING_DIRECTORY is set, then the command will be run in that "
"directory.  If it is a relative path it will be interpreted relative to the "
"build tree directory corresponding to the current source directory.  If "
"COMMENT is set, the value will be displayed as a message before the commands "
"are executed at build time.  Dependencies listed with the DEPENDS argument "
"may reference files and outputs of custom commands created with "
"add_custom_command() in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt file)."

"If VERBATIM is given then all arguments to the commands will be escaped "
"properly for the build tool so that the invoked command receives each "
"argument unchanged.  Note that one level of escapes is still used by the "
"CMake language processor before add_custom_target even sees the arguments.  "
"Use of VERBATIM is recommended as it enables correct behavior.  When "
"VERBATIM is not given the behavior is platform specific because there is no "
"protection of tool-specific special characters."
