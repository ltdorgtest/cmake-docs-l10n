"By including this file, all library files listed in the variable "
"CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS will be installed with "
"install(PROGRAMS ...) into bin for WIN32 and lib for non-WIN32.  If "
"CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_SKIP is set to TRUE before including this "
"file, then the INSTALL command is not called.  The user can use the variable "
"CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS to use a custom install command and "
"install them however they want.  If it is the MSVC compiler, then the "
"microsoft run time libraries will be found and automatically added to the "
"CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS, and installed.  If "
"CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES is set and it is the MSVC compiler, then the "
"debug libraries are installed when available.  If "
"CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES_ONLY is set then only the debug libraries are "
"installed when both debug and release are available.  If "
"CMAKE_INSTALL_MFC_LIBRARIES is set then the MFC run time libraries are "
"installed as well as the CRT run time libraries.  If "
"CMAKE_INSTALL_OPENMP_LIBRARIES is set then the OpenMP run time libraries are "
"installed as well.  If CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_DESTINATION is set then "
"the libraries are installed to that directory rather than the default.  If "
"CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_NO_WARNINGS is NOT set, then this file "
"warns about required files that do not exist.  You can set this variable to "
"ON before including this file to avoid the warning.  For example, the Visual "
"Studio Express editions do not include the redistributable files, so if you "
"include this file on a machine with only VS Express installed, you'll get "
"the warning."
