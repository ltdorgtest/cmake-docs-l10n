"Define a function named <name> that takes arguments named arg1 arg2 arg3 "
"(...).  Commands listed after function, but before the matching endfunction, "
"are not invoked until the function is invoked.  When it is invoked, the "
"commands recorded in the function are first modified by replacing formal "
"parameters (${arg1}) with the arguments passed, and then invoked as normal "
"commands.  In addition to referencing the formal parameters you can "
"reference the variable ARGC which will be set to the number of arguments "
"passed into the function as well as ARGV0 ARGV1 ARGV2 ...  which will have "
"the actual values of the arguments passed in.  This facilitates creating "
"functions with optional arguments.  Additionally ARGV holds the list of all "
"arguments given to the function and ARGN holds the list of arguments past "
"the last expected argument."
