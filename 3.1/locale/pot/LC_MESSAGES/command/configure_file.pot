"This command replaces any variables in the input file referenced as ${VAR} "
"or @VAR@ with their values as determined by CMake.  If a variable is not "
"defined, it will be replaced with nothing.  If COPYONLY is specified, then "
"no variable expansion will take place.  If ESCAPE_QUOTES is specified then "
"any substituted quotes will be C-style escaped.  The file will be configured "
"with the current values of CMake variables.  If @ONLY is specified, only "
"variables of the form @VAR@ will be replaced and ${VAR} will be ignored.  "
"This is useful for configuring scripts that use ${VAR}."
