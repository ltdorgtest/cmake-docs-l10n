"In CMake 3.12 and above the :command:`find_package(<PackageName>)` command "
"now searches prefixes specified by the :variable:`<PackageName>_ROOT` CMake "
"variable and the :envvar:`<PackageName>_ROOT` environment variable. Package "
"roots are maintained as a stack so nested calls to all ``find_*`` commands "
"inside find modules also search the roots as prefixes.  This policy provides "
"compatibility with projects that have not been updated to avoid using "
"``<PackageName>_ROOT`` variables for other purposes."
