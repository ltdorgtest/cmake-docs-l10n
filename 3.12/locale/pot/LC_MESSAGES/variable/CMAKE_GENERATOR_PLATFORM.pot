"Some CMake generators support a target platform name to be given to the "

"be available in this variable."

"The value of this variable should never be modified by project code. A "

"may initialize ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM``.  Once a given build tree has "
"been initialized with a particular value for this variable, changing the "
"value has undefined behavior."
