"Default compilation flags to be used when compiling ``resource`` files. Will "
"only be used by CMake on the first configuration to determine ``resource`` "
"default compilation flags, after which the value for ``RCFLAGS`` is stored "
"in the cache as :variable:`CMAKE_RC_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>`. For any "
"configuration run (including the first), the environment variable will be "
"ignored if the :variable:`CMAKE_RC_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>` variable is "
