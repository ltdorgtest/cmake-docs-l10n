"The error added by 3.13.3 in cases that neither a source or binary directory "
"is specified has been downgraded to a warning.  While this was never "
"intended, documented, nor supported behavior, some projects relied on it.  "
"The error has been downgraded to a warning for the remainder of the 3.13.x "
"release series to allow a transition period, but it may become a fatal error "
"again in a later release.  Scripts relying on the old behavior can be "
"trivially fixed by specifying the path to the source tree (even if just ``."
