"Add a list of subdirectories to the build.  The :command:`add_subdirectory` "
"command should be used instead of ``subdirs`` although ``subdirs`` will "
"still work.  This will cause any CMakeLists.txt files in the sub directories "
"to be processed by CMake.  Any directories after the ``PREORDER`` flag are "
"traversed first by makefile builds, the ``PREORDER`` flag has no effect on "
"IDE projects.  Any directories after the ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` marker will "
"not be included in the top level makefile or project file.  This is useful "
"for having CMake create makefiles or projects for a set of examples in a "
"project.  You would want CMake to generate makefiles or project files for "
"all the examples at the same time, but you would not want them to show up in "
"the top level project or be built each time make is run from the top."
