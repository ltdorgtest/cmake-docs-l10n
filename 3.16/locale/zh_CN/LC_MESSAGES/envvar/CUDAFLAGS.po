"Default compilation flags to be used when compiling ``CUDA`` files. Will "
"only be used by CMake on the first configuration to determine ``CUDA`` "
"default compilation flags, after which the value for ``CUDAFLAGS`` is stored "
"in the cache as :variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>`. For any "
"configuration run (including the first), the environment variable will be "
"ignored if the :variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>` variable is "
