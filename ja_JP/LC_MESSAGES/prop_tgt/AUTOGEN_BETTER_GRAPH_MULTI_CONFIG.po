"``AUTOGEN_BETTER_GRAPH_MULTI_CONFIG`` is a boolean property that can be set "
"on a target to have better dependency graph for multi-configuration "
"generators. When this property is enabled, ``CMake`` will generate more per-"
"config targets. Thus, the dependency graph will be more accurate for multi-"
"configuration generators and some recompilations will be avoided."

"If the Qt version is 6.8 or newer, this property is enabled by default. If "
"the Qt version is older than 6.8, this property is disabled by default. "
