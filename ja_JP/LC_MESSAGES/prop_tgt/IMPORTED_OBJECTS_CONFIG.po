"Do not use this ``<CONFIG>``-specific property if you need to use Xcode "
"variables like ``$(CURRENT_ARCH)`` or ``$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME)`` in the "
"value.  The ``<CONFIG>``-specific properties will be ignored in such cases "
"because CMake cannot determine whether a file exists at the configuration-"
"specific path at configuration time.  For such cases, use :prop_tgt:"
"`IMPORTED_OBJECTS` instead."
