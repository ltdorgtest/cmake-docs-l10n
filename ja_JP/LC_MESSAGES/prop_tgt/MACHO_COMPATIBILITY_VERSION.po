"For shared libraries on Mach-O systems (e.g. macOS, iOS) the "
"``MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION`` property corresponds to the *compatibility "
"version* and :prop_tgt:`MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION` corresponds to the *current "
"version*.  These are both embedded in the shared library binary and can be "
"checked with the ``otool -L <binary>`` command."

"It should be noted that the :prop_tgt:`MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION` and "
"``MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION`` properties do not affect the file names or "
"version-related symlinks that CMake generates for the library. The :prop_tgt:"
"`VERSION` and :prop_tgt:`SOVERSION` target properties still control the file "
"and symlink names.  The ``install_name`` is also still controlled by :"
"prop_tgt:`SOVERSION`."

"When :prop_tgt:`MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION` and ``MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION`` "
"are not given, :prop_tgt:`VERSION` and :prop_tgt:`SOVERSION` are used for "
"the version details to be embedded in the binaries respectively. The :"
"prop_tgt:`MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION` and ``MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION`` "
"properties only need to be given if the project needs to decouple the file "
"and symlink naming from the version details embedded in the binaries (e.g. "
"to match libtool conventions)."
