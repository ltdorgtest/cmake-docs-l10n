"The ``OSX_ARCHITECTURES`` property sets the target binary architecture for "
"targets on macOS (``-arch``).  This property is initialized by the value of "
"the variable :variable:`CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES` if it is set when a target "
"is created.  Use :prop_tgt:`OSX_ARCHITECTURES_<CONFIG>` to set the binary "
"architectures on a per-configuration basis, where ``<CONFIG>`` is an upper-"
"case name (e.g. ``OSX_ARCHITECTURES_DEBUG``)."
