"This module is intended to be used in :ref:`Find Modules` when finding "
"packages that are available with multiple :ref:`Build Configurations`.  It "
"provides a macro that automatically sets and adjusts library variables.  "
"Supported library build configurations are ``Release`` and ``Debug`` as "
"these are the most common ones in such packages."

"This module has been available since early versions of CMake, when the "
"``<PackageName>_LIBRARIES`` result variable was used for linking found "
"packages.  When writing standard find modules, :ref:`Imported Targets` "
"should be preferred.  In addition to or as an alternative to this module, "
"imported targets provide finer control over linking through the :prop_tgt:"
"`IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS` property."
