"Though Producer isn't directly part of OpenSceneGraph, its primary user is "
"OSG so I consider this part of the Findosg* suite used to find "
"OpenSceneGraph components.  You'll notice that I accept OSGDIR as an "

"Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module.  You must "
"also opt into OpenGL (and OpenThreads?) as these modules won't do it for "
"you.  This is to allow you control over your own system piece by piece in "
"case you need to opt out of certain components or change the Find behavior "
"for a particular module (perhaps because the default FindOpenGL.cmake module "
"doesn't work with your system as an example). If you want to use a more "
"convenient module that includes everything, use the FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake "
"instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules."
