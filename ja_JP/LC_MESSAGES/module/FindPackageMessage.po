"This macro is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake modules files.  It will "
"print a message once for each unique find result.  This is useful for "
"telling the user where a package was found.  The first argument specifies "
"the name (XXX) of the package.  The second argument specifies the message to "
"display.  The third argument lists details about the find result so that if "
"they change the message will be displayed again.  The macro also obeys the "
"QUIET argument to the find_package command."
