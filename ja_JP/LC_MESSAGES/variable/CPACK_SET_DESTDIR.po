"DESTDIR means DESTination DIRectory.  It is commonly used by makefile users "
"in order to install software at non-default location.  It is a basic "
"relocation mechanism that should not be used on Windows (see "
"CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX documentation).  It is usually invoked like this:"

"which will install the concerned software using the installation prefix, e."
"g.  \"/usr/local\" prepended with the DESTDIR value which finally gives \"/"
"home/john/usr/local\".  When preparing a package, CPack first installs the "
"items to be packaged in a local (to the build tree) directory by using the "
"same DESTDIR mechanism.  Nevertheless, if CPACK_SET_DESTDIR is set then "
"CPack will set DESTDIR before doing the local install.  The most noticeable "
"difference is that without CPACK_SET_DESTDIR, CPack uses "
"CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX as a prefix whereas with CPACK_SET_DESTDIR "
"set, CPack will use CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX as a prefix."

"Manually setting CPACK_SET_DESTDIR may help (or simply be necessary) if some "
"install rules uses absolute DESTINATION (see CMake INSTALL command).  "
"However, starting with CPack/CMake 2.8.3 RPM and DEB installers tries to "
"handle DESTDIR automatically so that it is seldom necessary for the user to "
"set it."
