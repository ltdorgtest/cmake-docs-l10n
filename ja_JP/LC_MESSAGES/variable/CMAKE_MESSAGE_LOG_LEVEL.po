"When set, this variable specifies the logging level used by the :command:"
"`message` command.  Valid values are the same as those for the ``--log-"
"level`` command line option of the :manual:`cmake(1)` program. If this "
"variable is set and the ``--log-level`` command line option is given, the "
"command line option takes precedence."

"The main advantage to using this variable is to make a log level persist "
"between CMake runs.  Setting it as a cache variable will ensure that "
"subsequent CMake runs will continue to use the chosen log level."
