"Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building executables "
"etc on systems that use RPATH.  When the software is installed the "
"executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the install RPATH.  If this "
"variable is set to ``TRUE`` then the software is always built with no RPATH."
