"This read-only directory property contains a :ref:`semicolon-separated list "
"<CMake Language Lists>` of subdirectories processed so far by the :command:"
"`add_subdirectory` or :command:`subdirs` commands.  Each entry is the "
"absolute path to the source directory (containing the ``CMakeLists.txt`` "
"file).  This is suitable to pass to the :command:`get_property` command "
"``DIRECTORY`` option."
