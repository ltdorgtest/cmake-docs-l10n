"Mark the named cached variables as advanced.  An advanced variable will not "
"be displayed in any of the cmake GUIs unless the show advanced option is "
"on.  If ``CLEAR`` is the first argument advanced variables are changed back "
"to unadvanced.  If ``FORCE`` is the first argument, then the variable is "
"made advanced.  If neither ``FORCE`` nor ``CLEAR`` is specified, new values "
"will be marked as advanced, but if the variable already has an advanced/non-"
"advanced state, it will not be changed."
