msgid ""
"This command generates CMake variables and targets from pkg-config format "
"package files natively, without needing to invoke or even require the "
"presence of a pkg-config implementation. A ``<package>`` is either an "
"absolute path to a package file, or a package name to be searched for using "
"the typical pkg-config search patterns. The optional ``<version>`` string "
"has the same format and semantics as a pkg-config style version specifier, "
"with the exception that if no comparison operator is specified ``=`` is "
"assumed."

"``cmake_pkg_config`` may recursively generate target-like names in the "
"global scope in order to resolve a package ``IMPORT`` or ``POPULATE`` "
"command. These names take the form of ``@foreign_pkgcfg::"
"[<prefix>_]<package>`` and are exposed via the :prop_tgt:"
"`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` target property of an ``IMPORT``-generated target."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../command/cmake_pkg_config.rst:41
msgid ""
"It is not possible to modify or address these pkg-config native targets via "
"normal target-based commands. Limited control over their generation is "
"possible via the ``POPULATE`` command, but modification should generally be "
"performed inside the corresponding package file, not downstream in CMake."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../command/cmake_pkg_config.rst:46

"Pkg-config targets are reused across commands. Once a given package name has "
"been resolved via ``POPULATE`` or ``IMPORT`` (but not ``EXTRACT``), all "
"future requests for the corresponding package name by those commands will "
"resolve to the previously generated pkg-config target."
