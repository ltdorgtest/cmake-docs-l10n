"When a third-party utility's source is included in the distribution, this "
"command specifies its location and name.  The cache entry will not be set "
"unless the ``path_to_source`` and all listed files exist.  It is assumed "
"that the source tree of the utility will have been built before it is needed."

msgid ""
"When cross compiling CMake will print a warning if a ``utility_source()`` "
"command is executed, because in many cases it is used to build an executable "
"which is executed later on.  This doesn't work when cross compiling, since "
"the executable can run only on their target platform. So in this case the "
"cache entry has to be adjusted manually so it points to an executable which "
"is runnable on the build host."
