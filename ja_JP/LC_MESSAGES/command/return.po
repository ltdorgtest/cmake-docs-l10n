"Returns from a file, directory or function.  When this command is "
"encountered in an included file (via :command:`include` or :command:"
"`find_package`), it causes processing of the current file to stop and "
"control is returned to the including file.  If it is encountered in a file "
"which is not included by another file, e.g.  a ``CMakeLists.txt``, control "
"is returned to the parent directory if there is one.  If return is called in "
"a function, control is returned to the caller of the function."

"Note that a :command:`macro <macro>`, unlike a :command:`function "
"<function>`, is expanded in place and therefore cannot handle ``return()``."
