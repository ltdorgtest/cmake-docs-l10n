"The version of macOS that the resulting PackageMaker archive should be "
"compatible with. Different versions of macOS support different features. For "
"example, CPack can only build component-based installers for macOS 10.4 or "
"newer, and can only build installers that download component son-the-fly for "
"macOS 10.5 or newer. If left blank, this value will be set to the minimum "
"version of macOS that supports the requested features. Set this variable to "
"some value (e.g., 10.4) only if you want to guarantee that your installer "
"will work on that version of macOS, and don't mind missing extra features "
"available in the installer shipping with later versions of macOS."
