"CMake 3.3 and below, for historical reasons, always linked executables on "
"some platforms with flags like ``-rdynamic`` to export symbols from the "
"executables for use by any plugins they may load via ``dlopen``. CMake 3.4 "
"and above prefer to do this only for executables that are explicitly marked "
"with the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to always use the additional link "

"`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property."

"The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to only use the additional link flags "

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.4.  Unlike most policies, "
"CMake version |release| does *not* warn by default when this policy is not "
"set and simply uses OLD behavior.  See documentation of the :variable:"
"`CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0065 <CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP<NNNN>>` variable to "
"control the warning."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-"
