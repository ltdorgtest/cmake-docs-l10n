"When a ``VERSION <major>[.<minor>[.<patch>[.<tweak>]]]]`` argument is given "
"to the :command:`project` command, it stores the version string in the "
"``PROJECT_VERSION`` variable and stores individual integer version "
"components in ``PROJECT_VERSION_{MAJOR,MINOR,PATCH,TWEAK}`` variables (see "
"policy :policy:`CMP0048`).  CMake 3.15 and below dropped leading zeros from "
"each component.  CMake 3.16 and higher prefer to preserve leading zeros.  "
"This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated "
"to expect the new behavior."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy drops leading zeros in all components, e."
"g.  such that version ``1.07.06`` becomes ``1.7.6``.  The ``NEW`` behavior "
"of this policy preserves the leading zeros in all components, such that "
"version ``1.07.06`` remains unchanged."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.16.  Unlike many policies, "
"CMake version |release| does *not* warn when this policy is not set and "
"simply uses the ``OLD`` behavior.  Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command "
"to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly."
