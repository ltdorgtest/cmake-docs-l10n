"Previously, setting :prop_tgt:`BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH` had the effect of "
"setting both the ``install_name`` of a target to :prop_tgt:"
"`INSTALL_NAME_DIR` and the ``RPATH`` to :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_RPATH`.  In CMake "
"3.9, it only affects setting of ``RPATH``.  However, if one wants :prop_tgt:"
"`INSTALL_NAME_DIR` to apply to the target in the build tree, one may set :"
