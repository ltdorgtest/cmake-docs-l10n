"CMake 2.6.3 and below silently permitted add_subdirectory() calls to create "
"the same binary directory multiple times.  During build system generation "
"files would be written and then overwritten in the build tree and could lead "
"to strange behavior.  CMake 2.6.4 and above explicitly detect duplicate "
"binary directories.  CMake 2.6.4 always considers this case an error.  In "
"CMake 2.8.0 and above this policy determines whether or not the case is an "
"error.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow duplicate binary "
"directories.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to disallow duplicate "
"binary directories with an error."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.0.  CMake version |release| "
"warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use the :"
"command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly."
