msgid ""
"Ancient CMake versions once used ``<tgt>_LIB_DEPENDS`` cache entries to "
"propagate library link dependencies.  This has long been done by other "
"means, leaving the :command:`export_library_dependencies` command as the "
"only user of these values.  That command has long been disallowed by policy :"
"policy:`CMP0033`, but the ``<tgt>_LIB_DEPENDS`` cache entries were left for "
"compatibility with possible non-standard uses by projects."

msgid ""
"CMake 3.12 and above now prefer to not produce these cache entries at all.  "
"This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated "
"to avoid using them."

msgid ""
"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to set ``<tgt>_LIB_DEPENDS`` cache "
"entries.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to not set them."

msgid ""
"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.12.  Use the :command:"
"`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly. Unlike "
"most policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn when this policy is "
"not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior."

#: ../../../policy/DEPRECATED.txt:2
msgid ""
"The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-"
"policies(7)>` and may be removed in a future version of CMake."
