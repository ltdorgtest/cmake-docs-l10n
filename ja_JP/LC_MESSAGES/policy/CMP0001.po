"In CMake 2.4 and below the variable ``CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY`` was "
"used to request compatibility with earlier versions of CMake.  In CMake 2.6 "
"and above all compatibility issues are handled by policies and the :command:"

"``CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY`` for projects written for CMake 2.4 and "
