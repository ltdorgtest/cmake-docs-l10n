"This command was added in August 2002 to allow projects to add arbitrary "
"commands implemented in C or C++.  However, it does not work when the "
"toolchain in use does not match the ABI of the CMake process.  It has been "
"mostly superseded by the :command:`macro` and :command:`function` commands."

"CMake >= |disallowed_version| prefer that this command never be called. The "
"``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow the command to be called. The "
"``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to issue a ``FATAL_ERROR`` when the "
"command is called."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version |disallowed_version|. CMake "
"version |release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` "
"behavior.  Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or "
"``NEW`` explicitly."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-"
