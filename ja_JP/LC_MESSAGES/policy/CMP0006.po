"This policy determines whether the install(TARGETS) command must be given a "
"BUNDLE DESTINATION when asked to install a target with the MACOSX_BUNDLE "
"property set.  CMake 2.4 and below did not distinguish application bundles "
"from normal executables when installing targets. CMake 2.6 provides a BUNDLE "
"option to the install(TARGETS) command that specifies rules specific to "
"application bundles on the Mac. Projects should use this option when "
"installing a target with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set."

"The OLD behavior for this policy is to fall back to the RUNTIME DESTINATION "
"if a BUNDLE DESTINATION is not given.  The NEW behavior for this policy is "
"to produce an error if a bundle target is installed without a BUNDLE "
"DESTINATION."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.  CMake version |release| "
"warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use the "
"cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly."
