"In CMake 2.6.2 and below, incorrect variable reference syntax such as a "
"missing close-brace (``${FOO``) was reported but did not stop processing of "
"CMake code.  This policy determines whether a bad variable reference is an "
"error.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to warn about the error, "
"leave the string untouched, and continue. The ``NEW`` behavior for this "
"policy is to report an error."
