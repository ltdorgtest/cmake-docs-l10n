"This command was added in January 2003 to export ``<tgt>_LIB_DEPENDS`` "
"internal CMake cache entries to a file for installation with a project. This "
"was used at the time to allow transitive link dependencies to work for "
"applications outside of the original build tree of a project. The "
"functionality has been superseded by the :command:`export` and :command:"
"`install(EXPORT)` commands."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version |disallowed_version|. CMake "
"version |release| warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  "
