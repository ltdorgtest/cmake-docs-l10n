"In CMake 2.8.0 and lower the :command:`link_directories` command passed "
"relative paths unchanged to the linker.  In CMake 2.8.1 and above the :"
"command:`link_directories` command prefers to interpret relative paths with "
"respect to ``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR``, which is consistent with :command:"
"`include_directories` and other commands.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this "
"policy is to use relative paths verbatim in the linker command.  The ``NEW`` "
"behavior for this policy is to convert relative paths to absolute paths by "
"appending the relative path to ``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR``."
