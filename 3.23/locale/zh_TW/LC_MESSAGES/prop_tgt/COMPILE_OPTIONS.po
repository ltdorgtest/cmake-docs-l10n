"This property holds a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` "
"of options specified so far for its target.  Use the :command:"
"`target_compile_options` command to append more options. The options will be "
"added after after flags in the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` and :variable:"
"`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>` variables, but before those propagated from "
"dependencies by the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS` property."

"Contents of ``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` may use \"generator expressions\" with the "

msgid ""
"The final set of options used for a target is constructed by accumulating "
"options from the current target and the usage requirements of its "
"dependencies.  The set of options is de-duplicated to avoid repetition."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../command/OPTIONS_SHELL.txt:8
msgid ""
"While beneficial for individual options, the de-duplication step can break "
"up option groups.  For example, ``-option A -option B`` becomes ``-option A "
"B``.  One may specify a group of options using shell-like quoting along with "
"a ``SHELL:`` prefix.  The ``SHELL:`` prefix is dropped, and the rest of the "
"option string is parsed using the :command:`separate_arguments` "
"``UNIX_COMMAND`` mode. For example, ``\"SHELL:-option A\" \"SHELL:-option "
"B\"`` becomes ``-option A -option B``."
