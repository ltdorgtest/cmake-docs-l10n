"By default the directories specified are appended onto the current list of "
"directories.  This default behavior can be changed by setting :variable:"
"`CMAKE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_BEFORE` to ``ON``.  By using ``AFTER`` or "

"If the ``SYSTEM`` option is given, the compiler will be told the directories "

"setting might achieve effects such as the compiler skipping warnings, or "
"these fixed-install system files not being considered in dependency "
"calculations - see compiler docs."
