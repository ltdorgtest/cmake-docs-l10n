"Some linkers support switches such as ``-Bstatic`` and ``-Bdynamic`` to "
"determine whether to use static or shared libraries for ``-lXXX`` options. "
"CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full paths "
"are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for the "
"platform.  By default the linker search type is assumed to be ``-Bdynamic`` "
"at the beginning of the library list.  This property switches the assumption "
"to ``-Bstatic``.  It is intended for use when linking an executable "
"statically (e.g. with the GNU ``-static`` option)."
