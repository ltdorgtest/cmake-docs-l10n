"As CMake evolves it is sometimes necessary to change existing behavior in "
"order to fix bugs or improve implementations of existing features. The CMake "
"Policy mechanism is designed to help keep existing projects building as new "
"versions of CMake introduce changes in behavior.  Each new policy "
"(behavioral change) is given an identifier of the form ``CMP<NNNN>`` where "
"``<NNNN>`` is an integer index.  Documentation associated with each policy "
"describes the ``OLD`` and ``NEW`` behavior and the reason the policy was "
"introduced.  Projects may set each policy to select the desired behavior.  "
"When CMake needs to know which behavior to use it checks for a setting "
"specified by the project.  If no setting is available the ``OLD`` behavior "
"is assumed and a warning is produced requesting that the policy be set."

"``<min>`` and the optional ``<max>`` are each CMake versions of the form "
"``major.minor[.patch[.tweak]]``, and the ``...`` is literal.  The ``<min>`` "
"version must be at least ``2.4`` and at most the running version of CMake. "
"The ``<max>`` version, if specified, must be at least the ``<min>`` version "
"but may exceed the running version of CMake.  If the running version of "
"CMake is older than 3.12, the extra ``...`` dots will be seen as version "
"component separators, resulting in the ``...<max>`` part being ignored and "
"preserving the pre-3.12 behavior of basing policies on ``<min>``."

"This specifies that the current CMake code is written for the given range of "

"will be set to use ``NEW`` behavior.  All policies introduced in later "
"versions will be unset (unless the :variable:"
"`CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>` variable sets a default). This effectively "
"requests behavior preferred as of a given CMake version and tells newer "
"CMake versions to warn about their new policies."
