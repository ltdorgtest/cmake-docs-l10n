":module:`FindBISON` runs bison in :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` when "
"executing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The module provides a ``BISON_TARGET`` macro which generates BISON output. "
"In CMake 3.13 and below the macro would generate a custom command that runs "
"``bison`` in the source directory.  CMake 3.14 and later prefer to run it in "
"the build directory and use :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` as the "
"``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` of its :command:`add_custom_command` invocation. This "
"ensures that any implicitly generated file is written to the build tree "
"rather than the source."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is for ``BISON_TARGET`` to use the "
"current source directory for the ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` and where to generate "
"implicit files. The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to use the current "
"binary directory for the ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` and where to generate "
"implicit files."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.14.  Use the :command:"
"`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly. Unlike "
"most policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn when this policy is "
"not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior."

msgid ""
"The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-"
"policies(7)>` and may be removed in a future version of CMake."
