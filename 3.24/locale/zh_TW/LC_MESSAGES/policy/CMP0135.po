"When using the ``URL`` download method with the :command:"
"`ExternalProject_Add` command, CMake 3.23 and below sets the timestamps of "
"the extracted contents to the same as the timestamps in the archive. When "
"the ``URL`` changes, the new archive is downloaded and extracted, but the "
"timestamps of the extracted contents might not be newer than the previous "
"contents. Anything that depends on the extracted contents might not be "
"rebuilt, even though the contents may change."

"CMake 3.24 and above prefers to set the timestamps of all extracted contents "
"to the time of the extraction. This ensures that anything that depends on "
"the extracted contents will be rebuilt whenever the ``URL`` changes."

"The ``DOWNLOAD_EXTRACT_TIMESTAMP`` option to the :command:"
"`ExternalProject_Add` command can be used to explicitly specify how "
"timestamps should be handled. When ``DOWNLOAD_EXTRACT_TIMESTAMP`` is not "
"given, this policy controls the default behavior. The ``OLD`` behavior for "
"this policy is to restore the timestamps from the archive. The ``NEW`` "
"behavior sets the timestamps of extracted contents to the time of extraction."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.24.  CMake version |release| "
