"One known use case for this identifier is to disambiguate the variables in "
"an anonymous namespace in a limited scope. Anonymous namespaces present a "
"problem for unity builds because they are used to ensure that certain "
"variables and declarations are scoped to a translation unit which is "
"approximated by a single source file.  When source files are combined in a "
"unity build file, those variables in different files are combined in a "
"single translation unit and the names clash.  This property can be used to "
"avoid that with code like the following:"
