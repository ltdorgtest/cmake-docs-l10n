"CMake 3.15 and above recognize that IBM's Clang-based XL compilers that "
"define ``__ibmxl__`` are a new front-end distinct from ``xlc`` with a "
"different command line and set of capabilities. CMake now prefers to present "
"this to projects by setting the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` "
"variable to ``XLClang`` instead of ``XL``.  However, existing projects may "
"assume the compiler id for Clang-based XL is just ``XL`` as it was in CMake "
"versions prior to 3.15. Therefore this policy determines for Clang-based XL "
"compilers which compiler id to report in the :variable:"
"`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable after language ``<LANG>`` is enabled by "
"the :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language` command.  The policy "
"must be set prior to the invocation of either command."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to use compiler id ``XL``.  The "

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.15.  Use the :command:"
"`cmake_policy` command to set this policy to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly. "
"Unlike most policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn by default "
"when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior. See "
"documentation of the :variable:`CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0089 "
"<CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP<NNNN>>` variable to control the warning."

msgid ""
"The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-"
