"A test driver is a program that links together many small tests into a "
"single executable.  This is useful when building static executables with "
"large libraries to shrink the total required size.  The list of source files "
"needed to build the test driver will be in ``sourceListName``.  "
"``driverName`` is the name of the test driver program. The rest of the "
"arguments consist of a list of test source files, can be semicolon "
"separated.  Each test source file should have a function in it that is the "
"same name as the file with no extension (foo.cxx should have int foo(int, "
"char*[]);) ``driverName`` will be able to call each of the tests by name on "
"the command line.  If ``EXTRA_INCLUDE`` is specified, then the next argument "
"is included into the generated file. If ``FUNCTION`` is specified, then the "
"next argument is taken as a function name that is passed a pointer to ac and "
"av.  This can be used to add extra command line processing to each test.  "
"The ``CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_BEFORE_TESTMAIN`` cmake variable can be set to have "
"code that will be placed directly before calling the test main function. "
"``CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_AFTER_TESTMAIN`` can be set to have code that will be "
"placed directly after the call to the test main function."
