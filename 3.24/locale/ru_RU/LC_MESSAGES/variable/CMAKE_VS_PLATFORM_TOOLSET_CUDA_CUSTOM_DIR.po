"The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above support using a "
"standalone (non-installed) NVIDIA CUDA toolkit.  The path may be specified "
"by a field in :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET` of the form ``cuda=C:"
"\\path\\to\\cuda``.  The given directory must at least contain the nvcc "
"compiler in path ``.\\bin`` and must provide Visual Studio integration files "
"in path ``.\\extras\\visual_studio_integration\\ MSBuildExtensions\\``. One "

"with 7zip or copying the files that are extracted by the running installer. "
"The value may be empty if no path to a standalone CUDA Toolkit was specified."
