"This property contains the list of transitive link dependencies.  When the "
"target is linked into another target using the :command:"
"`target_link_libraries` command, the libraries listed (and recursively their "
"link interface libraries) will be provided to the other target also.  This "
"property is overridden by the :prop_tgt:`LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES` or :"
"prop_tgt:`LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>` property if policy :policy:"

"The value of this property is used by the generators when constructing the "
"link rule for a dependent target.  A dependent target's direct link "
"dependencies, specified by its :prop_tgt:`LINK_LIBRARIES` target property, "
"are linked first, followed by indirect dependencies from the transitive "
"closure of the direct dependencies' ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` "
"properties.  See policy :policy:`CMP0022`."

"A call to :command:`target_link_libraries(<target> ...)` may update this "
"property on ``<target>``.  If ``<target>`` was not created in the same "
"directory as the call then :command:`target_link_libraries` will wrap each "
"entry with the form ``::@(directory-id);...;::@``, where the ``::@`` is "
"literal and the ``(directory-id)`` is unspecified. This tells the generators "
"that the named libraries must be looked up in the scope of the caller rather "
"than in the scope in which the ``<target>`` was created.  Valid directory "
"ids are stripped on export by the :command:`install(EXPORT)` and :command:"
"`export` commands."
