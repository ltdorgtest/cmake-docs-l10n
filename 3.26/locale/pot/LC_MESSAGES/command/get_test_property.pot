"Get a property from the test.  The value of the property is stored in the "
"variable ``VAR``.  If the test property is not found, the behavior depends "
"on whether it has been defined to be an ``INHERITED`` property or not (see :"
"command:`define_property`).  Non-inherited properties will set ``VAR`` to "
"\"NOTFOUND\", whereas inherited properties will search the relevant parent "
"scope as described for the :command:`define_property` command and if still "
"unable to find the property, ``VAR`` will be set to an empty string."
