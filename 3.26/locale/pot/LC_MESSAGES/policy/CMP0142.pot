"In CMake 3.24 and below, the :generator:`Xcode` generator preceded each "
"entry of a library search path with a copy of itself appended with "
"``$(CONFIGURATION)$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME)``.  This was left from very "
"early versions of CMake in which per-config directories were not well "
"modeled.  Such paths often do not exist, resulting in warnings from the "
"toolchain.  CMake 3.25 and above prefer to not add such library search "
"paths.  This policy provides compatibility for projects that may have been "
"accidentally relying on the old behavior."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to append "
"``$(CONFIGURATION)$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME)`` to all library search paths. "
"The ``NEW`` behavior is to not modify library search paths."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.25.  Use the :command:"
"`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly. Unlike "
"many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn when this policy is "
"not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior."

msgid ""
"The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-"
"policies(7)>` and may be removed in a future version of CMake."
