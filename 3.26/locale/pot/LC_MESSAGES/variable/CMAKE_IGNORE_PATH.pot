"For :command:`find_program`, :command:`find_library`, :command:`find_file`, "
"and :command:`find_path`, any file found in one of the listed directories "
"will be ignored. The listed directories do not apply recursively, so any "
"subdirectories to be ignored must also be explicitly listed. |"
"CMAKE_IGNORE_VAR| does not affect the search *prefixes* used by these four "
"commands. To ignore individual paths under a search prefix (e.g. ``bin``, "
"``include``, ``lib``, etc.), each path must be listed in |CMAKE_IGNORE_VAR| "
"as a full absolute path. |CMAKE_IGNORE_PREFIX_VAR| provides a more "
"appropriate way to ignore a whole search prefix."

":command:`find_package` is also affected by |CMAKE_IGNORE_VAR|, but only for "
"*Config mode* searches. Any ``<Name>Config.cmake`` or ``<name>-config."
"cmake`` file found in one of the specified directories will be ignored. In "
"addition, any search *prefix* found in |CMAKE_IGNORE_VAR| will be skipped "
"for backward compatibility reasons, but new code should prefer to use |"
"CMAKE_IGNORE_PREFIX_VAR| to ignore prefixes instead."

"Ignoring search locations can be useful in cross-compiling environments "
"where some system directories contain incompatible but possibly linkable "
"libraries. For example, on cross-compiled cluster environments, this allows "
"a user to ignore directories containing libraries meant for the front-end "
"machine."
