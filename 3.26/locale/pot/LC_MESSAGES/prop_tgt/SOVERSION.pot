"For shared libraries :prop_tgt:`VERSION` and ``SOVERSION`` can be used to "
"specify the build version and API version respectively.  When building or "
"installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports "
"symlinks and the linker supports so-names.  If only one of both is specified "
"the missing is assumed to have the same version number. ``SOVERSION`` is "
"ignored if :prop_tgt:`NO_SONAME` property is set."
