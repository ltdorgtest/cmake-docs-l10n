"Compilers typically pass directories containing language runtime libraries "
"and default library search paths when they invoke a linker. These paths are "
"implicit linker search directories for the compiler's language.  For each "
"language enabled by the :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language` "
"command, CMake automatically detects these directories and reports the "
"results in this variable."

msgid ""
"When linking to a static library, CMake adds the implicit link directories "
"from this variable for each language used in the static library (except the "
"language whose compiler is used to drive linking).  In the case of an "
"imported static library, the :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES` "
"target property lists the languages whose implicit link information is "
"needed.  If any of the languages is not enabled, its value for the "
"``CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES`` variable may instead be provided "
"by the project.  Or, a :variable:`toolchain file <CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>` may "
"set the variable to a value known for the specified toolchain.  It will "
"either be overridden when the language is enabled, or used as a fallback."

"Some toolchains read implicit directories from an environment variable such "
"as ``LIBRARY_PATH``.  If using such an environment variable, keep its value "
"consistent when operating in a given build tree because CMake saves the "
"value detected when first creating a build tree."

"If policy :policy:`CMP0060` is not set to ``NEW``, then when a library in "
"one of these directories is given by full path to :command:"
"`target_link_libraries` CMake will generate the ``-l<name>`` form on link "
"lines for historical purposes."
