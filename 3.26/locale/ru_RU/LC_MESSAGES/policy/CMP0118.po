"Whether or not a source file is generated is an all-or-nothing global "
"property of the source.  Consequently, the associated ``GENERATED`` property "
"is now visible from any directory scope, not only from the scope for which "
"it was set."

"Additionally, the ``GENERATED`` property may now be set only to boolean "
"values, and may not be turned off once turned on."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to only allow ``GENERATED`` to be "
"visible from the directory scope for which it was set.  The ``NEW`` behavior "
"on the other hand allows it to be visible from any scope."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.20.  Use the :command:"
"`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly. Unlike "
"many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn when this policy is "
"not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior with regard to visibility of the "
"``GENERATED`` property.  However, CMake does warn about setting the "
"``GENERATED`` property to a non-boolean value."
