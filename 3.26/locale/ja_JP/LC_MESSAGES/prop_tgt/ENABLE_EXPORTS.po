"Normally an executable does not export any symbols because it is the final "
"program.  It is possible for an executable to export symbols to be used by "
"loadable modules.  When this property is set to true CMake will allow other "
"targets to \"link\" to the executable with the :command:"
"`target_link_libraries` command.  On all platforms a target-level dependency "
"on the executable is created for targets that link to it. Handling of the "
"executable on the link lines of the loadable modules varies by platform:"

"On Windows-based systems (including Cygwin) an \"import library\" is created "

"On AIX, a linker \"import file\" is created along with the executable to "

"On other platforms, loadable modules are simply linked without referencing "
"the executable since the dynamic loader will automatically bind symbols when "
"the module is loaded."
