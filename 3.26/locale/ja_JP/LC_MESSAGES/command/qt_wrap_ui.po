"This command was originally added to support Qt 3 before the :command:"
"`add_custom_command()` command was sufficiently mature.  The :module:"
"`FindQt4` module provides the ``qt4_wrap_ui()`` macro, which should be used "
"instead for Qt 4 projects.  For projects using Qt 5 or later, use the "
"equivalent macro provided by Qt itself (e.g. Qt 5 provides "
"``qt5_wrap_ui()``)."
