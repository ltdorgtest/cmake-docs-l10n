"When using the :generator:`Xcode` generator, libraries to be linked will be "
"specified in the Xcode project file using either the \"Link Binary With "
"Libraries\" build phase or directly as linker flags.  The former allows "
"Xcode to manage build paths, which may be necessary when creating Xcode "
"archives because it may use different build paths to a regular build."
