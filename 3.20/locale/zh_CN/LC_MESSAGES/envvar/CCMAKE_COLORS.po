"Values are an integer number that specifies what color to use. ``0`` is "
"black (you probably don't want to use that). Others are determined by your "
"terminal's color support. Most (color) terminals will support at least 8 or "
"16 colors. Some will support up to 256 colors. The colors will likely match "
"`this chart <https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/"
"Xterm_256color_chart.svg>`_, although the first 16 colors may match the "
"original `CGA color palette <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Color_Graphics_Adapter#Color_palette>`_. (Many modern terminal emulators "
"also allow their color palette, at least for the first 16 colors, to be "
"configured by the user.)"
