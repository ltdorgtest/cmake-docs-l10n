"When linking a shared library or executable that exports symbols using GNU "
"tools on Windows (MinGW/MSYS) with Visual Studio installed convert the "
"import library (``.dll.a``) from GNU to MS format (``.lib``).  Both import "
"libraries will be installed by :command:`install(TARGETS)` and exported by :"
"command:`install(EXPORT)` and  :command:`export` to be linked by "
"applications with either GNU- or MS-compatible tools."

"If the variable ``CMAKE_GNUtoMS`` is set when a target is created its value "
"is used to initialize this property.  The variable must be set prior to the "
"first command that enables a language such as :command:`project` or :command:"
"`enable_language`.  CMake provides the variable as an option to the user "
"automatically when configuring on Windows with GNU tools."
