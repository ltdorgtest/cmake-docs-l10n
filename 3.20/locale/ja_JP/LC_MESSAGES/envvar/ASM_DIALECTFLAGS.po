"Default compilation flags to be used when compiling a specific dialect of an "
"assembly language. ``ASM<DIALECT>FLAGS`` can be ``ASMFLAGS``, "
"``ASM_NASMFLAGS``, ``ASM_MASMFLAGS`` or ``ASM-ATTFLAGS``. Will only be used "
"by CMake on the first configuration to determine ``ASM_<DIALECT>`` default "
"compilation flags, after which the value for ``ASM<DIALECT>FLAGS`` is stored "
"in the cache as ``CMAKE_ASM<DIALECT>_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>``.  For any "
"configuration run (including the first), the environment variable will be "
"ignored, if the ``CMAKE_ASM<DIALECT>_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>`` variable "
"is defined."
