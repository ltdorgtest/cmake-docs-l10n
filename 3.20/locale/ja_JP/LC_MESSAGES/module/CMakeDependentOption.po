"``<option>`` is available, the given ``<help_text>`` and initial ``<value>`` "

"element in the fourth parameter is evaluated as an if-condition, so :ref:"

"If ``USE_BAR`` is true and ``USE_ZOT`` is false, this provides an option "
"called ``USE_FOO`` that defaults to ON. Otherwise, it sets ``USE_FOO`` to "
"OFF and hides the option from the user. If the status of ``USE_BAR`` or "
"``USE_ZOT`` ever changes, any value for the ``USE_FOO`` option is saved so "
"that when the option is re-enabled it retains its old value."
