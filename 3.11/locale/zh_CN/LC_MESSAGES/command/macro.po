"Define a macro named ``<name>`` that takes arguments named ``arg1``, "
"``arg2``, ``arg3``, (...). Commands listed after macro, but before the "
"matching :command:`endmacro()`, are not invoked until the macro is invoked. "
"When it is invoked, the commands recorded in the macro are first modified by "
"replacing formal parameters (``${arg1}``) with the arguments passed, and "
"then invoked as normal commands. In addition to referencing the formal "
"parameters you can reference the values ``${ARGC}`` which will be set to the "
"number of arguments passed into the function as well as ``${ARGV0}``, "
"``${ARGV1}``, ``${ARGV2}``, ...  which will have the actual values of the "
"arguments passed in. This facilitates creating macros with optional "
"arguments. Additionally ``${ARGV}`` holds the list of all arguments given to "
"the macro and ``${ARGN}`` holds the list of arguments past the last expected "
"argument. Referencing to ``${ARGV#}`` arguments beyond ``${ARGC}`` have "
"undefined behavior. Checking that ``${ARGC}`` is greater than ``#`` is the "
"only way to ensure that ``${ARGV#}`` was passed to the function as an extra "
"argument."

"Note that the parameters to a macro and values such as ``ARGN`` are not "

"In the first case, you can use ``if(${ARGV1})``. In the second and third "
