"The logical name of executable and library targets does not have to "
"correspond to the physical file names built.  Consider using the OUTPUT_NAME "
"target property to create two targets with the same physical name while "
"keeping logical names distinct.  Custom targets must simply have globally "
"unique names (unless one uses the global property "
"ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS with a Makefiles generator)."
