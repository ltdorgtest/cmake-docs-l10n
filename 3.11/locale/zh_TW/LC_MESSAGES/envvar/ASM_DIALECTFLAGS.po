"Default compilation flags to be used when compiling a specific dialect of an "
"assembly language. ``ASM<DIALECT>FLAGS`` can be ``ASMFLAGS``, "
"``ASM_NASMFLAGS``, ``ASM_MASMFLAGS`` or ``ASM-ATTFLAGS``. Will only be used "
"by CMake on the first configuration to determine ``ASM<DIALECT>`` default "
"compilation flags, after which the value for ``ASM<DIALECT>FLAGS`` is stored "
"in the cache as :variable:`CMAKE_ASM<DIALECT>_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>`. "
"For any configuration run (including the first), the environment variable "
"will be ignored if the :variable:`CMAKE_ASM<DIALECT>_FLAGS "
"<CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>` variable is defined."
