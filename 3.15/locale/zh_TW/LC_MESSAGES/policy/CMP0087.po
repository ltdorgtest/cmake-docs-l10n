"Note that it is the value of this policy setting at the end of the directory "
"scope that is important, not its setting at the time of the call to :command:"
"`install(CODE)` or :command:`install(SCRIPT)`.  This has implications for "
"calling these commands from places that have their own policy scope but not "
"their own directory scope (e.g. from files brought in via :command:"
"`include()` rather than :command:`add_subdirectory()`)."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.14.  CMake version |release| "
