"CPack provides many generators to create packages for a variety of platforms "
"and packaging systems. The intention is for CMake/CPack to be a complete end-"
"to-end solution for building and packaging a software project. However, it "
"may not always be possible to use CPack for the entire packaging process, "
"due to either technical limitations or policies that require the use of "
"certain tools. For this reason, CPack provides the \"External\" generator, "
"which allows external packaging software to take advantage of some of the "
"functionality provided by CPack, such as component installation and the "
"dependency graph."

"The CPack External generator generates a ``.json`` file containing the CPack "

"incompatible changes (for example, deleting a field or changing its meaning) "
