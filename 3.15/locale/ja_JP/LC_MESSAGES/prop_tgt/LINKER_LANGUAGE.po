"For executables, shared libraries, and modules, this sets the language whose "
"compiler is used to link the target (such as \"C\" or \"CXX\").  A typical "
"value for an executable is the language of the source file providing the "
"program entry point (main).  If not set, the language with the highest "
"linker preference value is the default.  See documentation of :variable:"
"`CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE` variables."
