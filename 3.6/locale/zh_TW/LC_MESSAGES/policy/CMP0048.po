"CMake version 3.0 introduced the ``VERSION`` option of the :command:"
"`project` command to specify a project version as well as the name.  In "
"order to keep :variable:`PROJECT_VERSION` and related variables consistent "
"with variable :variable:`PROJECT_NAME` it is necessary to set the VERSION "
"variables to the empty string when no ``VERSION`` is given to :command:"
"`project`. However, this can change behavior for existing projects that set "
"VERSION variables themselves since :command:`project` may now clear them. "
"This policy controls the behavior for compatibility with such projects."

"The OLD behavior for this policy is to leave VERSION variables untouched. "
