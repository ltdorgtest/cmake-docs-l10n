"CMake requires that projects specify the version of CMake to which they have "
"been written.  This policy has been put in place so users trying to build "
"the project may be told when they need to update their CMake.  Specifying a "
"version also helps the project build with CMake versions newer than that "
"specified.  Use the cmake_minimum_required command at the top of your main "
"CMakeLists.txt file:"

"where \"<major>.<minor>\" is the version of CMake you want to support (such "

"CMake is running and help newer versions be compatible with the project.  "

"Note that the command invocation must appear in the CMakeLists.txt file "
"itself; a call in an included file is not sufficient.  However, the "
"cmake_policy command may be called to set policy CMP0000 to OLD or NEW "
"behavior explicitly.  The OLD behavior is to silently ignore the missing "
"invocation.  The NEW behavior is to issue an error instead of a warning.  An "
"included file may set CMP0000 explicitly to affect how this policy is "
"enforced for the main CMakeLists.txt file."
