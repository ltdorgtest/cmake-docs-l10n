"Set to a true value to ask CTest to launch the test process with CPU "
"affinity for a fixed set of processors.  If enabled and supported for the "
"current platform, CTest will choose a set of processors to place in the CPU "
"affinity mask when launching the test process.  The number of processors in "
"the set is determined by the :prop_test:`PROCESSORS` test property or the "
"number of processors available to CTest, whichever is smaller.  The set of "
"processors chosen will be disjoint from the processors assigned to other "
"concurrently running tests that also have the ``PROCESSOR_AFFINITY`` "
"property enabled."
