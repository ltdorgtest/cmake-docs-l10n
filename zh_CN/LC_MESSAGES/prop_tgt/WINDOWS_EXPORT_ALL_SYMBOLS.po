"Enable this boolean property to automatically create a module definition (``."
"def``) file with all global symbols found in the input ``.obj`` files for a "
"``SHARED`` library (or executable with :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS`) on "
"Windows.  The module definition file will be passed to the linker causing "
"all symbols to be exported from the ``.dll``. For global *data* symbols, "
"``__declspec(dllimport)`` must still be used when compiling against the code "
"in the ``.dll``.  All other function symbols will be automatically exported "
"and imported by callers.  This simplifies porting projects to Windows by "
"reducing the need for explicit ``dllexport`` markup, even in ``C++`` classes."

"When this property is enabled, zero or more ``.def`` files may also be "
"specified as source files of the target.  The exports named by these files "
"will be merged with those detected from the object files to generate a "
"single module definition file to be passed to the linker.  This can be used "
"to export symbols from a ``.dll`` that are not in any of its object files "
"but are added by the linker from dependencies (e.g. ``msvcrt.lib``)."
