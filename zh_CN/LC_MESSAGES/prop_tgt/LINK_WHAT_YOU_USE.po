"This is a boolean option that, when set to ``TRUE``, will automatically run "
"contents of variable :variable:`CMAKE_LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE_CHECK` on the target "
"after it is linked. In addition, the linker flag specified by variable :"
"variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE_FLAG`  will be passed to the target "
"with the link command so that all libraries specified on the command line "
"will be linked into the target. This will result in the link producing a "
"list of libraries that provide no symbols used by this target but are being "
"linked to it."
