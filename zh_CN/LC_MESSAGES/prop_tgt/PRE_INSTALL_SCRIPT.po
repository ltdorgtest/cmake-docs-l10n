"The ``PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT`` and :prop_tgt:`POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT` properties "
"are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run before and after installing "
"a target.  They are used only when the old ``INSTALL_TARGETS`` command is "
"used to install the target.  Use the :command:`install` command instead."
