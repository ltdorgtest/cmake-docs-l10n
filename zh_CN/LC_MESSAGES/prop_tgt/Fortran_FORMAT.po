"This property tells CMake whether the Fortran source files in a target use "
"fixed-format or free-format.  CMake will pass the corresponding format flag "
"to the compiler.  Use the source-specific Fortran_FORMAT property to change "
"the format of a specific source file.  If the variable CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT "
"is set when a target is created its value is used to initialize this "
"property."
