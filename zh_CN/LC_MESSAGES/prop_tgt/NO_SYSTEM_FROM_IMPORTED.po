"When the consumed target's :prop_tgt:`SYSTEM` property is set to true, the "
"contents of the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` target property "
"are treated as system includes or, on Apple platforms, when the target is a "
"framework, it will be treated as system.  By default, :prop_tgt:`SYSTEM` is "
"true for imported targets and false for other target types.  If the "
"``NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED`` property is set to true on a *consuming* target, "
"compilation of sources in that consuming target will not treat the contents "
"of the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of consumed imported "
"targets as system includes, even if that imported target's :prop_tgt:"
"`SYSTEM` property is false."

"Directories listed in the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` "
