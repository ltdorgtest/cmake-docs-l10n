"When an ELF or XCOFF binary needs to have a different runtime library search "
"path after installation than it does in the build tree, CMake uses a builtin "
"editor to change the runtime search path in the installed copy. If this "
"variable is set to true then CMake will relink the binary before "
"installation instead of using its builtin editor."
