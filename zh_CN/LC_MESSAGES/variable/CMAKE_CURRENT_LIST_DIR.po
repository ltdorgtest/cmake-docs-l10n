"As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will always "
"be set to the directory where the listfile which is currently being "
"processed (:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE`) is located.  The value has "
"dynamic scope.  When CMake starts processing commands in a source file it "
"sets this variable to the directory where this file is located. When CMake "
"finishes processing commands from the file it restores the previous value.  "
"Therefore the value of the variable inside a macro or function is the "
"directory of the file invoking the bottom-most entry on the call stack, not "
"the directory of the file containing the macro or function definition."
