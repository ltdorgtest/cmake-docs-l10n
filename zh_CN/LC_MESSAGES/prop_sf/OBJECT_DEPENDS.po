"This property need not be used to specify the dependency of a source file on "
"a generated header file that it includes.  Although the property was "
"originally introduced for this purpose, it is no longer necessary.  If the "
"generated header file is created by a custom command in the same target as "
"the source file, the automatic dependency scanning process will recognize "
"the dependency.  If the generated header file is created by another target, "
"an inter-target dependency should be created with the :command:"
"`add_dependencies` command (if one does not already exist due to linking "
"relationships)."
