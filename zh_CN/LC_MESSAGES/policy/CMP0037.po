"CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed creating targets using :command:"
"`add_library`, :command:`add_executable` and :command:`add_custom_target` "
"with unrestricted choice for the target name.  Newer cmake features such as :"
"manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` and some diagnostics expect target "
"names to match a restricted pattern."

"Target names may contain upper and lower case letters, numbers, the "
"underscore character (``_``), dot(``.``), plus(``+``) and minus(``-``). As a "
"special case, ``ALIAS`` and ``IMPORTED`` targets may contain two consecutive "
"colons."

"Target names associated with optional features, such as ``test`` and "
"``package``, may also be reserved.  CMake 3.10 and below always reserve "

"modules)."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow creating targets with "

"This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. "
"Prior to removal in CMake version |REMOVED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|, it could be "
"set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:`cmake_minimum_required`. If it "
"was not set, CMake |WARNED_OR_DID_NOT_WARN|, and used ``OLD`` behavior."
