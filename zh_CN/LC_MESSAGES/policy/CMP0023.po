"CMake 2.8.12 introduced the target_link_libraries signature using the "
"PUBLIC, PRIVATE, and INTERFACE keywords to generalize the LINK_PUBLIC and "
"LINK_PRIVATE keywords introduced in CMake 2.8.7.  Use of signatures with any "
"of these keywords sets the link interface of a target explicitly, even if "
"empty.  This produces confusing behavior when used in combination with the "
"historical behavior of the plain target_link_libraries signature.  For "
"example, consider the code:"

"After the first line the link interface has not been set explicitly so CMake "
"would use the link implementation, A, as the link interface. However, the "
"second line sets the link interface to empty.  In order to avoid this subtle "
"behavior CMake now prefers to disallow mixing the plain and keyword "
"signatures of target_link_libraries for a single target."
