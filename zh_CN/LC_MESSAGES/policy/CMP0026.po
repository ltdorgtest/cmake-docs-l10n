"CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed reading the :prop_tgt:`LOCATION` target "
"property (and configuration-specific variants) to determine the eventual "
"location of build targets.  This relies on the assumption that all necessary "
"information is available at configure-time to determine the final location "
"and filename of the target.  However, this property is not fully determined "
"until later at generate-time.  At generate time, the :genex:`$<TARGET_FILE>` "
"generator expression can be used to determine the eventual :prop_tgt:"
"`LOCATION` of a target output."

"Code which reads the :prop_tgt:`LOCATION` target property can be ported to "
"use the :genex:`$<TARGET_FILE>` generator expression together with the :"

"location."

"was not set, CMake |WARNED_OR_DID_NOT_WARN|, and used ``OLD`` behavior."
