"Headers generated for :ref:`Qt AUTOMOC` are placed in target-specific "
"include directories.  CMake 3.26 and older added these as normal include "
"directories. CMake 3.27 and newer prefer to add them as system include "

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to add autogen include directory to "

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.27.  Use the :command:"
"`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly. Unlike "
"many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn when this policy is "
"not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-"
