"CMake 3.20 and below always leave the loop variable set at the end of the "
"loop, either to the value it had before the loop, if any, or to the empty "
"string.  CMake 3.21 and above prefer to leave the loop variable in the state "
"it had before the loop started, either set or unset.  This policy provides "
"compatibility for projects that expect the loop variable to always be left "
"set."
