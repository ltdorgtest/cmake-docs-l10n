"The :cpack_gen:`CPack DragNDrop Generator` in CMake 3.22 and below attach a "
"Software License Agreement (SLA) to ``.dmg`` files using the file specified "
"by :variable:`CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE`, if set to a non-default value. "
"macOS 12.0 deprecated the tools used to do this, so CMake 3.23 added the :"
"variable:`CPACK_DMG_SLA_USE_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE` option to control the "
"behavior.  CMake 3.23 enables that option by default for compatibility with "
"older versions. CMake 3.24 and above prefer to *not* enable the :variable:"
"`CPACK_DMG_SLA_USE_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE` option by default. This policy "
"provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated to account "
"for the lack of a SLA in their ``.dmg`` packages."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.24.  Use the :command:"
"`cmake_policy` command to set this policy to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly. "
"Unlike many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn by default "
"when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior. See "
"documentation of the :variable:`CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0133 "
"<CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP<NNNN>>` variable to control the warning."
