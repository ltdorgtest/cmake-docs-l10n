"This policy determines whether the list command will ignore empty elements "
"in the list.  CMake 2.4 and below list commands ignored all empty elements "
"in the list.  For example, ``a;b;;c`` would have length 3 and not 4.  The "
"``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore empty list elements.  The "
"``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to correctly count empty elements in a "
"list."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. "
"Prior to removal in CMake version |REMOVED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|, it could be "
"set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:`cmake_minimum_required`. If it "
"was not set, CMake |WARNED_OR_DID_NOT_WARN|, and used ``OLD`` behavior."
