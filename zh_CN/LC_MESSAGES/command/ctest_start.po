"Starts the testing for a given model.  The command should be called after "
"the binary directory is initialized.  If the 'source' and 'binary' directory "
"are not specified, it reads the CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY and "
"CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY.  If the track is specified, the submissions will go "
"to the specified track.  If APPEND is used, the existing TAG is used rather "
"than creating a new one based on the current time stamp."
