"Returns from a file, directory or function.  When this command is "
"encountered in an included file (via include() or find_package()), it causes "
"processing of the current file to stop and control is returned to the "
"including file.  If it is encountered in a file which is not included by "
"another file, e.g.  a CMakeLists.txt, control is returned to the parent "
"directory if there is one.  If return is called in a function, control is "
"returned to the caller of the function.  Note that a macro is not a function "
"and does not handle return like a function does."
