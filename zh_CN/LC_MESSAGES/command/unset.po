"Removes a normal variable from the current scope, causing it to become "
"undefined.  If ``CACHE`` is present, then a cache variable is removed "
"instead of a normal variable.  Note that when evaluating :ref:`Variable "
"References` of the form ``${VAR}``, CMake first searches for a normal "
"variable with that name.  If no such normal variable exists, CMake will then "
"search for a cache entry with that name.  Because of this unsetting a normal "
"variable can expose a cache variable that was previously hidden.  To force a "
"variable reference of the form ``${VAR}`` to return an empty string, use "
"``set(<variable> \"\")``, which clears the normal variable but leaves it "
"defined."
