"The ``cmake_add_fortran_subdirectory`` function adds a subdirectory to a "
"project that contains a fortran-only subproject.  The module will check the "
"current compiler and see if it can support fortran.  If no fortran compiler "
"is found and the compiler is MSVC, then this module will find the MinGW "
"gfortran.  It will then use an external project to build with the MinGW "
"tools.  It will also create imported targets for the libraries created.  "
"This will only work if the fortran code is built into a dll, so :variable:"
"`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` is turned on in the project.  In addition the :variable:"
"`CMAKE_GNUtoMS` option is set to on, so that Microsoft ``.lib`` files are "
"created.  Usage is as follows:"
