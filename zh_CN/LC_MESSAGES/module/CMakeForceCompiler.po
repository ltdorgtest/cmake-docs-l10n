"The macros provided by this module were once intended for use by cross-"
"compiling toolchain files when CMake was not able to automatically detect "
"the compiler identification.  Since the introduction of this module, CMake's "
"compiler identification capabilities have improved and can now be taught to "
"recognize any compiler.  Furthermore, the suite of information CMake detects "
"from a compiler is now too extensive to be provided by toolchain files using "
"these macros."

"The only known remaining use case for these macros is to write toolchain "
"files for cross-compilers that cannot link binaries without special flags or "
"custom linker scripts.  These macros cause CMake to skip checks it normally "
"performs as part of enabling a language and introspecting the toolchain. "
"However, skipping these checks may limit some generation functionality."
