"This module invokes the ``HDF5`` wrapper compiler that should be installed "
"alongside ``HDF5``.  Depending upon the ``HDF5`` Configuration, the wrapper "
"compiler is called either ``h5cc`` or ``h5pcc``.  If this succeeds, the "
"module will then call the compiler with the show argument to see what flags "
"are used when compiling an ``HDF5`` client application."

"The module will optionally accept the ``COMPONENTS`` argument.  If no "
"``COMPONENTS`` are specified, then the find module will default to finding "
"only the ``HDF5`` C library.  If one or more ``COMPONENTS`` are specified, "
"the module will attempt to find the language bindings for the specified "
"components.  The valid components are ``C``, ``CXX``, ``Fortran``, ``HL``. "
"``HL`` refers to the \"high-level\" HDF5 functions for C and Fortran. If the "
"``COMPONENTS`` argument is not given, the module will attempt to find only "
"the C bindings. For example, to use Fortran HDF5 and HDF5-HL functions, do: "
"``find_package(HDF5 COMPONENTS Fortran HL)``."

"This module will read the variable ``HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES`` to "
"determine whether or not to prefer a static link to a dynamic link for "
"``HDF5`` and all of it's dependencies. To use this feature, make sure that "
"the ``HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES`` variable is set before the call to "
"find_package."

"Both the serial and parallel ``HDF5`` wrappers are considered and the first "
"directory to contain either one will be used.  In the event that both appear "

"``TRUE``."
