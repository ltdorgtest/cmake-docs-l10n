"For compatibility with older versions of CMake, the now-deprecated variable "
"``DOXYGEN_DOT_PATH`` is set to the path to the directory containing ``dot`` "
"as reported in ``DOXYGEN_DOT_EXECUTABLE``. The path may have forward slashes "
"even on Windows and is not suitable for direct substitution into a "
"``Doxyfile.in`` template. If you need this value, use :command:"
"`get_filename_component` to compute it from ``DOXYGEN_DOT_EXECUTABLE`` "
"directly, and perhaps the :command:`file(TO_NATIVE_PATH)` command to prepare "
"the path for a Doxygen configuration file."
