"Get a property from a target.  The value of the property is stored in the "
"variable ``VAR``.  If the target property is not found, the behavior depends "
"on whether it has been defined to be an ``INHERITED`` property or not (see :"
"command:`define_property`).  Non-inherited properties will set ``VAR`` to "
"``NOTFOUND``, whereas inherited properties will search the relevant parent "
"scope as described for the :command:`define_property` command and if still "
"unable to find the property, ``VAR`` will be set to an empty string."

"Use :command:`set_target_properties` to set target property values. "
"Properties are usually used to control how a target is built, but some query "
"the target instead.  This command can get properties for any target so far "
"created.  The targets do not need to be in the current ``CMakeLists.txt`` "
"file."
