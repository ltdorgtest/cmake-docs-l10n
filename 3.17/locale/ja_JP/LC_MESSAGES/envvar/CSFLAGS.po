"Preferred executable for compiling ``CSharp`` language files. Will only be "
"used by CMake on the first configuration to determine ``CSharp`` default "
"compilation flags, after which the value for ``CSFLAGS`` is stored in the "
"cache as :variable:`CMAKE_CSharp_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>`. For any "
"configuration run (including the first), the environment variable will be "
"ignored if the :variable:`CMAKE_CSharp_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>` variable "
"is defined."
