"This is a boolean option that when set to ``TRUE`` will automatically run "
"``ldd -r -u`` on the target after it is linked. In addition, the linker flag "
"``-Wl,--no-as-needed`` will be passed to the target with the link command so "
"that all libraries specified on the command line will be linked into the "
"target. This will result in the link producing a list of libraries that "
"provide no symbols used by this target but are being linked to it. This is "
"only applicable to executable and shared library targets and will only work "
"when ld and ldd accept the flags used."
