"The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above support using a "
"CUDA toolset provided by a CUDA Toolkit.  The toolset version number may be "
"specified by a field in :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET` of the form "
"``cuda=8.0``. Or it is automatically detected if a path to a standalone CUDA "
"directory is specified in the form ``cuda=C:\\path\\to\\cuda``. If none is "
"specified CMake will choose a default version. CMake provides the selected "
"CUDA toolset version in this variable. The value may be empty if no CUDA "
"Toolkit with Visual Studio integration is installed."
