"``STATIC``, ``SHARED``, or ``MODULE`` may be given to specify the type of "

"dynamically and loaded at runtime.  ``MODULE`` libraries are plugins that "
"are not linked into other targets but may be loaded dynamically at runtime "
"using dlopen-like functionality.  If no type is given explicitly the type is "
"``STATIC`` or ``SHARED`` based on whether the current value of the variable :"
"variable:`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` is ``ON``.  For ``SHARED`` and ``MODULE`` "
"libraries the :prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` target property is set "
