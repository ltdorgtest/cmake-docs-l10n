"It is quite common practice in CMake for modules to use some additional "
"files, such as templates to be copied in after substituting CMake variables. "
"In such cases, a function needs to know where to locate those files in a way "
"that doesn't depend on where the function is called.  Without "
"``CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR``, the code to do that would typically use "
"the following pattern:"

"Using ``CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR`` inside the function instead "
"eliminates the need for the extra variable which would otherwise be visible "
"outside the function's scope. The above example can be written in the more "
"concise and more robust form:"
