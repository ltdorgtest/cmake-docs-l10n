"In CMake 2.6.1 and below, :command:`file(GLOB_RECURSE)` calls would follow "
"through symlinks, sometimes coming up with unexpectedly large result sets "
"because of symlinks to top level directories that contain hundreds of "
"thousands of files."

"This policy determines whether or not to follow symlinks encountered during "
"a :command:`file(GLOB_RECURSE)` call.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy "
"is to follow the symlinks.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is not to "
"follow the symlinks by default, but only if ``FOLLOW_SYMLINKS`` is given as "
"an additional argument to the ``FILE`` command."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.2.  CMake version |release| "
