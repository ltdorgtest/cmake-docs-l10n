"Suppose, for the purpose of this tutorial, we decide that we never want to "
"use the platform ``log`` and ``exp`` functions and instead would like to "
"generate a table of precomputed values to use in the ``mysqrt`` function. In "
"this section, we will create the table as part of the build process, and "
"then compile that table into our application."

"First, let's remove the check for the ``log`` and ``exp`` functions in "
"``MathFunctions/CMakeLists.txt``. Then remove the check for ``HAVE_LOG`` and "
"``HAVE_EXP`` from ``mysqrt.cxx``. At the same time, we can remove :code:"
