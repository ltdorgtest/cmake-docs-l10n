"Tests the given build directory and stores results in Test.xml.  The second "
"argument is a variable that will hold value.  Optionally, you can specify "
"the starting test number START, the ending test number END, the number of "
"tests to skip between each test STRIDE, a regular expression for tests to "
"run INCLUDE, or a regular expression for tests to not run EXCLUDE.  "
"EXCLUDE_LABEL and INCLUDE_LABEL are regular expression for test to be "
"included or excluded by the test property LABEL.  PARALLEL_LEVEL should be "
"set to a positive number representing the number of tests to be run in "
"parallel.  SCHEDULE_RANDOM will launch tests in a random order, and is "
"typically used to detect implicit test dependencies.  STOP_TIME is the time "
"of day at which the tests should all stop running."
