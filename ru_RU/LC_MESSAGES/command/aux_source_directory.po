"Collects the names of all the source files in the specified directory and "
"stores the list in the ``<variable>`` provided.  This command is intended to "
"be used by projects that use explicit template instantiation.  Template "
"instantiation files can be stored in a ``Templates`` subdirectory and "
"collected automatically using this command to avoid manually listing all "
"instantiations."

"It is tempting to use this command to avoid writing the list of source files "
"for a library or executable target.  While this seems to work, there is no "
"way for CMake to generate a build system that knows when a new source file "
"has been added.  Normally the generated build system knows when it needs to "
"rerun CMake because the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file is modified to add a new "
"source.  When the source is just added to the directory without modifying "
"this file, one would have to manually rerun CMake to generate a build system "
"incorporating the new file."
