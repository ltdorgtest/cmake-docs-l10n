"``GREATER_EQUAL``, ``STREQUAL``, ``STRLESS``, ``STRLESS_EQUAL``, "
"``STRGREATER``, ``STRGREATER_EQUAL``, ``VERSION_EQUAL``, ``VERSION_LESS``, "
"``VERSION_LESS_EQUAL``, ``VERSION_GREATER``, ``VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL``, and "
"``MATCHES`` will be evaluated.  Then boolean ``NOT`` operators and finally "
"boolean ``AND`` and then ``OR`` operators will be evaluated."
