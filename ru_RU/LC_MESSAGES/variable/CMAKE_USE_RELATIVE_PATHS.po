"If this is set to TRUE, then CMake will use relative paths between the "
"source and binary tree.  This option does not work for more complicated "
"projects, and relative paths are used when possible.  In general, it is not "
"possible to move CMake generated makefiles to a different location "
"regardless of the value of this variable."
