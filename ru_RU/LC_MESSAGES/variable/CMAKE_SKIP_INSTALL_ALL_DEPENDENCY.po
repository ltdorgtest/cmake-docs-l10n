"By default, the \"install\" target depends on the \"all\" target.  This has "
"the effect, that when \"make install\" is invoked or INSTALL is built, first "
"the \"all\" target is built, then the installation starts. If "
"CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY is set to TRUE, this dependency is not "
"created, so the installation process will start immediately, independent "
"from whether the project has been completely built or not."
