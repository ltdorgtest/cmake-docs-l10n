"``CMakeLists.txt`` file, before any :command:`add_library` calls. Note that "
"if bringing external dependencies directly into the build, such as with :"
"module:`FetchContent` or a direct call to :command:`add_subdirectory`, and "
"one of those dependencies has such a call to :command:"
"`option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ...) <option>`, the top level project must also "
"call :command:`option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ...) <option>` before bringing in "
"its dependencies.  Failure to do so can lead to different behavior between "
"the first and subsequent CMake runs."
