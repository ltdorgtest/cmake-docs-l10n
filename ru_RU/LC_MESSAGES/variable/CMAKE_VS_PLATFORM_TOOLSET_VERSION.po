"The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2017 and above allow to select "
"minor versions of the same toolset. The toolset version number may be "
"specified by a field in :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET` of the form "
"``version=14.11``. If none is specified CMake will choose a default toolset. "
"The value may be empty if no minor version was selected and the default is "
"used."
