"CMake computes for every source file an object file name that is unique to "
"the source file and deterministic with respect to the full path to the "
"source file.  This allows multiple source files in a target to share the "
"same name if they lie in different directories without rebuilding when one "
"is added or removed.  However, it can produce long full paths in a few "
"cases, so CMake shortens the path using a hashing scheme when the full path "
"to an object file exceeds a limit.  CMake has a built-in limit for each "
"platform that is sufficient for common tools, but some native tools may have "
"a lower limit.  This variable may be set to specify the limit explicitly.  "
"The value must be an integer no less than 128."
