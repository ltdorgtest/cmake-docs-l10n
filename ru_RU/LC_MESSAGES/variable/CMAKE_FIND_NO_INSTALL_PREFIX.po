"Exclude the values of the :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` and :variable:"
"`CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX` variables from :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH`.  "
"CMake adds these project-destination prefixes to :variable:"
"`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH` by default in order to support building a series "
"of dependent packages and installing them into a common prefix.  Set "
"``CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX`` to ``TRUE`` to suppress this behavior."

"The :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH` is initialized on the first call to "
"a :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language` command.  Therefore one "
"must set ``CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX`` before this in order to take "
"effect.  A user may set the variable as a cache entry on the command line to "
"achieve this."

"Note that the prefix(es) may still be searched for other reasons, such as "
"being the same prefix as the CMake installation, or for being a built-in "
"system prefix."
