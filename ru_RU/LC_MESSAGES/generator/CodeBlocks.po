"Project files for CodeBlocks will be created in the top directory and in "
"every subdirectory which features a CMakeLists.txt file containing a "
"PROJECT() call.  Additionally a hierarchy of makefiles is generated into the "
"build tree. The :variable:`CMAKE_CODEBLOCKS_EXCLUDE_EXTERNAL_FILES` variable "
"may be set to ``ON`` to exclude any files which are located outside of the "
"project root directory. The appropriate make program can build the project "
"through the default make target.  A \"make install\" target is also provided."
