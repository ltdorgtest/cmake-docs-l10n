"CMAKE_EXPAND_IMPORTED_TARGETS() takes a list of libraries and replaces all "
"imported targets contained in this list with their actual file paths of the "
"referenced libraries on disk, including the libraries from their link "
"interfaces.  If a CONFIGURATION is given, it uses the respective "
"configuration of the imported targets if it exists.  If no CONFIGURATION is "
"given, it uses the first configuration from ${CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES} if "
"set, otherwise ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}. This macro is used by all Check*.cmake "
"files which use try_compile() or try_run() and support "
"CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES , so that these checks support imported targets in "
"CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES:"
