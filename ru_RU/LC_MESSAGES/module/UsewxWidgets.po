"As of CMake 3.27, a better approach is to link only the :module:`wxWidgets::"
"wxWidgets <FindwxWidgets>` ``IMPORTED`` target to specific targets that "
"require it, rather than including this module. Imported targets provide "
"better control of the package usage properties, such as include directories "
"and compile flags, by applying them only to the targets they are linked to, "
"avoiding unnecessary propagation to all targets in the current directory."
