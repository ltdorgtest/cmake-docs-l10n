"The ``INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` property informs consumers of "
"this target whether they must set their :prop_tgt:"
"`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` property to ``ON``.  If this property is set to "
"``ON``, then the :prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` property on  all "
"consumers will be set to ``ON``. Similarly, if this property is set to "
"``OFF``, then the :prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` property on all "
"consumers will be set to ``OFF``.  If this property is undefined, then "
"consumers will determine their :prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` "
"property by other means.  Consumers must ensure that the targets that they "
"link to have a consistent requirement for their "
"``INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` property."
