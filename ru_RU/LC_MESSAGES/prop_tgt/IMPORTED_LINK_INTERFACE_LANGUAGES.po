"Set this to the list of languages of source files compiled to produce a "
"STATIC IMPORTED library (such as \"C\" or \"CXX\").  CMake accounts for "
"these languages when computing how to link a target to the imported "
"library.  For example, when a C executable links to an imported C++ static "
"library CMake chooses the C++ linker to satisfy language runtime "
"dependencies of the static library."
