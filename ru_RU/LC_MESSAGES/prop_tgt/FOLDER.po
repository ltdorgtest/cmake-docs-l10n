"For IDEs that present targets using a folder hierarchy, this property "
"specifies the name of the folder to place the target under. To nest folders, "
"use ``FOLDER`` values such as ``GUI/Dialogs`` with ``/`` characters "
"separating folder levels.  Targets with no ``FOLDER`` property will appear "
"as top level entities.  Targets with the same ``FOLDER`` property value will "
"appear in the same folder as siblings."
