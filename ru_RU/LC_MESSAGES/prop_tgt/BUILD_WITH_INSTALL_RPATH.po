"BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to link the target "
"in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH.  This takes precedence over "
"SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the need for relinking before installation.  "
"This property is initialized by the value of the variable "
"CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH if it is set when a target is created."
