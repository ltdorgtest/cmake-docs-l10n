"from another project may not provide the same set of configuration names "

"imported configurations are suitable for use when building the ``<CONFIG>`` "
"configuration.  The first configuration in the list found to be provided by "
"the imported target (i.e. via :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>` for the "
