"The ``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN`` property may contain a list of "
"properties for this target whose minimum value may be read at generate time "
"when evaluated in the ``INTERFACE`` variant of the property of all linked "
"dependees.  For example, if a property ``FOO`` appears in the list, then for "
"each dependee, the ``INTERFACE_FOO`` property content in all of its "
"dependencies will be compared with each other and with the ``FOO`` property "
"in the depender. When reading the ``FOO`` property at generate time, the "
"minimum value will be returned.  If the property is not set, then it is "
"ignored."
