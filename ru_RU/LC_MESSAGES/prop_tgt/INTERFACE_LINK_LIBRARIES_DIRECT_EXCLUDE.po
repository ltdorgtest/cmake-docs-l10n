"This target property may be set to *exclude* items from a dependent target's "
"final set of direct link dependencies.  This property is processed after "
"the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT` target property of all other "
"dependencies of the dependent target, so exclusion from direct link "
"dependence takes priority over inclusion."

"The initial set of a dependent target's direct link dependencies is "
"specified by its :prop_tgt:`LINK_LIBRARIES` target property.  Indirect link "
"dependencies are specified by the transitive closure of the direct link "
"dependencies' :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` properties. Any link "
"dependency may specify additional direct link dependencies using the :"
"prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT` target property. The set of "
"direct link dependencies is then filtered to exclude items named by any "
"dependency's ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE`` target property."

"Excluding an item from a dependent target's direct link dependencies does "
"not mean the dependent target won't link the item.  The item may still be "
"linked as an indirect link dependency via the :prop_tgt:"
"`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` property on other dependencies."

"The |INTERFACE_PROPERTY_LINK_DIRECT| target property is intended for "
