":module:`FindFLEX` runs ``flex`` in directory :variable:"

"The module provides a ``FLEX_TARGET`` macro which generates FLEX output. In "
"CMake 3.16 and below the macro would generate a custom command that runs "
"``flex`` in the current source directory.  CMake 3.17 and later prefer to "
"run it in the build directory and use :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` "
"as the ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` of its :command:`add_custom_command` "
"invocation. This ensures that any implicitly generated file is written "
"relative to the build tree rather than the source tree, unless the generated "
"file is provided as absolute path."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is for ``FLEX_TARGET`` to use the "
"current source directory for the ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` and where to generate "
"implicit files. The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to use the current "
"binary directory for the ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` relative to which implicit "
"files are generated unless provided as absolute path."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.17.  Use the :command:"
"`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly. Unlike "
"many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn when this policy is "
"not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior."

msgid ""
"The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-"
