"The :prop_sf:`GENERATED` source file property is now visible in all "
"directories."

msgid ""
"In CMake 3.29 and below, the :prop_sf:`GENERATED` source file property, like "
"other source file properties, was scoped in every directory separately. "
"Although policy :policy:`CMP0118` allowed sources marked ``GENERATED`` in "
"one directory to be used in other directories without manually marking them "
"as ``GENERATED`` again, the ``GENERATED`` property was still not visible to :"
"command:`get_property` and :command:`get_source_file_property` calls."

msgid ""
"Whether or not a source file is generated is an all-or-nothing global "
"property of the source: a source is either generated or it is not. CMake "
"3.30 and above prefer to treat the :prop_sf:`GENERATED` source file property "
"as globally scoped.  Once it is set in one directory, it is immediately "
"visible to :command:`get_property` and :command:`get_source_file_property` "
"calls in other directories. This policy provides compatibility for projects "
"that have not been updated for this behavior."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for the ``GENERATED`` source file "
"property to be visible only in the directories in which it is set.  The "
"``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to allow the ``GENERATED`` source file "
"property to be visible in all directories once set in any directory. "
"Furthermore, the ``NEW`` behavior of this policy implies the ``NEW`` "
"behavior of policy :policy:`CMP0118`: the ``GENERATED`` property may be set "
"only to boolean values, and may not be turned off once turned on."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. "
"It may be set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:"
"`cmake_minimum_required`. If it is not set, CMake |WARNS_OR_DOES_NOT_WARN|, "
"and uses ``OLD`` behavior."

msgid ""
"The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-"
"policies(7)>` and may be removed in a future version of CMake."
