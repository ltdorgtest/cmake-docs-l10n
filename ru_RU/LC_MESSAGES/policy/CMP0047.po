"CMake 3.0 and above recognize that the QNX qcc compiler driver is different "
"from the GNU compiler. CMake now prefers to present this to projects by "
"setting the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable to ``QCC`` instead "
"of ``GNU``.  However, existing projects may assume the compiler id for QNX "
"qcc is just ``GNU`` as it was in CMake versions prior to 3.0. Therefore this "
"policy determines for QNX qcc which compiler id to report in the :variable:"
"`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable after language ``<LANG>`` is enabled by "
"the :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language` command.  The policy "
"must be set prior to the invocation of either command."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to use the ``GNU`` compiler id for "

"This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. "
"Prior to removal in CMake version |REMOVED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|, it could be "
"set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:`cmake_minimum_required`. If it "
"was not set, CMake |WARNED_OR_DID_NOT_WARN|, and used ``OLD`` behavior."
