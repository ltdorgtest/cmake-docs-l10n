"The macros provided by :module:`BundleUtilities` are intended to be invoked "
"at install time rather than at configure time, because they depend on the "
"listed targets already existing at the time they are invoked. If they are "
"invoked at configure time, the targets haven't been built yet, and the "
"commands will fail."

"This policy restricts the inclusion of :module:`BundleUtilities` to ``cmake -"
"P`` style scripts and install rules. Specifically, it looks for the presence "
"of :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR` and throws a fatal error if it exists."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to allow :module:`BundleUtilities` to "
"be included at configure time. The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to "
"disallow such inclusion."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.13.  CMake version |release| "
"warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior. Use the :command:"
"`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-"
