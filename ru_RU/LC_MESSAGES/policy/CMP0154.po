"CMake 3.27 and below assume that any file generated as an output or "
"byproduct of :command:`add_custom_command` or :command:`add_custom_target` "
"may be a public header file meant for inclusion by dependents' source "
"files.  This requires :ref:`Ninja Generators` to add conservative order-only "
"dependencies that prevent a target's source files from compiling before "
"custom commands from the target's dependencies are finished, even if those "
"custom commands only produce sources private to their own target."

":ref:`File Sets`, introduced by CMake 3.23, provide a way to express the "
"visibility of generated header files.  CMake 3.28 and above prefer to assume "
"that, in targets using file sets, generated files are private to their own "
"target by default.  Generated public headers must be specified as members of "
"a ``PUBLIC`` (or ``INTERFACE``) ``FILE_SET``, typically of type "
"``HEADERS``.  With this information, :ref:`Ninja Generators` may omit the "
"above-mentioned conservative dependencies and produce more efficient build "
"graphs."

"Additionally, if the custom command's output is a member of a file set of "
"type ``CXX_MODULES``, it will additionally not be required to exist before "
"compiling other sources in the same target.  Since these files should not be "
"included at compile time directly, they may not be implicitly required to "
"exist for other compilation rules."
