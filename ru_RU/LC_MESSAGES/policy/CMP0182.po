"CMake 3.30 and below always represented ``SHARED`` library targets as plain "
"shared object ``.so`` files.  This is consistent with other UNIX platforms, "
"but is not the preferred convention on AIX. CMake 3.31 added the :prop_tgt:"
"`AIX_SHARED_LIBRARY_ARCHIVE` target property to create a shared library "
"archive: the shared object ``.so`` file is placed inside an archive ``.a`` "
"file.  However, the behavior was disabled by default for compatibility with "
"existing projects that do not set :prop_tgt:`AIX_SHARED_LIBRARY_ARCHIVE`."
