":command:`add_library` rejects ``SHARED`` libraries when not supported by "

msgid ""
"In CMake 3.29 and below, on platforms that do not support shared libraries (:"
"prop_gbl:`TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS` is false), the :command:`add_library` "
"command automatically converts ``SHARED`` libraries to ``STATIC`` libraries "
"to help users build projects on such platforms.  However, the semantics of "
"shared and static libraries are different enough that such automatic "
"conversion cannot work in general.  Projects using shared libraries need to "
"be ported to such platforms on a case-by-case basis."

"In CMake 3.30 and above, :command:`add_library` prefers to reject creation "
"of shared libraries on platforms that do not support them, and fail with a "
"fatal error message.  This policy provides compatibility for projects that "
"happened to work with the automatic conversion to static libraries and have "
"not been updated with an explicit port."
