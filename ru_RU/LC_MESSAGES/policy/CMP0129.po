msgid ""
"CMake 3.23 and above recognize MCST LCC compiler as a different from "
"``GNU``, with its own command line and set of capabilities. CMake now "
"prefers to present this to projects by setting the :variable:"
"`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable to ``LCC`` instead of ``GNU``. However, "
"existing projects may assume the compiler id for LCC is ``GNU`` as it was in "
"CMake versions prior to 3.23. Therefore this policy determines for MCST LCC "
"compiler which compiler id to report in the :variable:"
"`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable after language ``<LANG>`` is enabled by "
"the :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language` command.  The policy "
"must be set prior to the invocation of either command."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to use compiler id ``GNU`` (and set :"
"variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION` to the supported GNU compiler "
"version.) ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to use compiler id ``LCC``, "
"and set :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_SIMULATE_ID` to ``GNU``, and :variable:"
"`CMAKE_<LANG>_SIMULATE_VERSION` to the supported GNU compiler version."
