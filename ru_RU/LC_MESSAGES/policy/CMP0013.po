"CMake 2.6.3 and below silently permitted add_subdirectory() calls to create "
"the same binary directory multiple times.  During build system generation "
"files would be written and then overwritten in the build tree and could lead "
"to strange behavior.  CMake 2.6.4 and above explicitly detect duplicate "
"binary directories.  CMake 2.6.4 always considers this case an error.  In "
"CMake 2.8.0 and above this policy determines whether or not the case is an "
"error.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow duplicate binary "
"directories.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to disallow duplicate "
"binary directories with an error."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. "
"Prior to removal in CMake version |REMOVED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|, it could be "
"set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:`cmake_minimum_required`. If it "
"was not set, CMake |WARNED_OR_DID_NOT_WARN|, and used ``OLD`` behavior."
