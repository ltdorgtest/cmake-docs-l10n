"Set this to the list of configurations of an imported target that may be "
"used for the current project's ``<CONFIG>`` configuration.  Targets imported "
"from another project may not provide the same set of configuration names "
"available in the current project.  Setting this property tells CMake what "
"imported configurations are suitable for use when building the ``<CONFIG>`` "
"configuration.  The first configuration in the list found to be provided by "
"the imported target (i.e. via :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>` for the "
"mapped-to ``<CONFIG>``) is selected.  As a special case, an empty list "
"element refers to the configuration-less imported target location (i.e. :"
"prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION`)."
