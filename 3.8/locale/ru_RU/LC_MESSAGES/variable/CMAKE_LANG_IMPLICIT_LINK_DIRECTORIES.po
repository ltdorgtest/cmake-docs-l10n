"Compilers typically pass directories containing language runtime libraries "
"and default library search paths when they invoke a linker. These paths are "
"implicit linker search directories for the compiler's language.  CMake "
"automatically detects these directories for each language and reports the "
"results in this variable."

"When a library in one of these directories is given by full path to :command:"
"`target_link_libraries` CMake will generate the ``-l<name>`` form on link "
"lines to ensure the linker searches its implicit directories for the "
"library.  Note that some toolchains read implicit directories from an "
"environment variable such as ``LIBRARY_PATH`` so keep its value consistent "
"when operating in a given build tree."
