":ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories to be *ignored* by the :"
"command:`find_program`, :command:`find_library`, :command:`find_file`, and :"
"command:`find_path` commands.  This is useful in cross-compiling "
"environments where some system directories contain incompatible but possibly "
"linkable libraries.  For example, on cross-compiled cluster environments, "
"this allows a user to ignore directories containing libraries meant for the "
"front-end machine."
