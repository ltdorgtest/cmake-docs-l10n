"This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be "
"used.  For some compilers, this results in adding a flag such as ``-std=gnu+"
"+11`` instead of ``-std=c++11`` to the compile line.  This property is "
"``ON`` by default. The basic CUDA/C++ standard level is controlled by the :"
"prop_tgt:`CUDA_STANDARD` target property."
