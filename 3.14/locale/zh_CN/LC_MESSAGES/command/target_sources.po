"The ``INTERFACE``, ``PUBLIC`` and ``PRIVATE`` keywords are required to "
"specify the scope of the following arguments.  ``PRIVATE`` and ``PUBLIC`` "
"items will populate the :prop_tgt:`SOURCES` property of ``<target>``.  "
"``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` items will populate the :prop_tgt:"
"`INTERFACE_SOURCES` property of ``<target>``. (:ref:`IMPORTED targets "
"<Imported Targets>` only support ``INTERFACE`` items.) The following "
"arguments specify sources.  Repeated calls for the same ``<target>`` append "
"items in the order called."
