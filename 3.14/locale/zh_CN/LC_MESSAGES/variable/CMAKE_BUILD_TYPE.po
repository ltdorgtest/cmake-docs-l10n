"This statically specifies what build type (configuration) will be built in "
"this build tree.  Possible values are empty, ``Debug``, ``Release``, "
"``RelWithDebInfo``, ``MinSizeRel``, ...  This variable is only meaningful to "
"single-configuration generators (such as :ref:`Makefile Generators` and :"
"generator:`Ninja`) i.e.  those which choose a single configuration when "
"CMake runs to generate a build tree as opposed to multi-configuration "
"generators which offer selection of the build configuration within the "
"generated build environment.  There are many per-config properties and "
"variables (usually following clean ``SOME_VAR_<CONFIG>`` order conventions), "
"such as ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS_<CONFIG>``, specified as uppercase: "
"``CMAKE_C_FLAGS_[DEBUG|RELEASE|RELWITHDEBINFO|MINSIZEREL|...]``.  For "
"example, in a build tree configured to build type ``Debug``, CMake will see "
"to having :variable:`CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG>` "
"settings get added to the :variable:`CMAKE_C_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>` "
"settings.  See also :variable:`CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES`."
