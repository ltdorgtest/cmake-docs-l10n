":prop_tgt:`AUTORCC_EXECUTABLE` is file path pointing to the ``rcc`` "
"executable to use for :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC` enabled files. Setting this "
"property will make CMake skip the automatic detection of the ``rcc`` binary "
"as well as the sanity-tests normally run to ensure that the binary is "
"available and working as expected."

"Usually this property does not need to be set. Only consider this property "
"if auto-detection of ``rcc`` can not work -- e.g. because you are building "
"the ``rcc`` binary as part of your project."
