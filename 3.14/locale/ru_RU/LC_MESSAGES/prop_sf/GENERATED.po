"Tells the internal CMake engine that a source file is generated by an "
"outside process such as another build step, or the execution of CMake "
"itself. This information is then used to exempt the file from any existence "
"or validity checks. Generated files are created by the execution of commands "

"When a generated file created by an :command:`add_custom_command` command is "
"explicitly listed as a source file for any target in the same directory "
"scope (which usually means the same ``CMakeLists.txt`` file), CMake will "
"automatically create a dependency to make sure the file is generated before "
"building that target."
