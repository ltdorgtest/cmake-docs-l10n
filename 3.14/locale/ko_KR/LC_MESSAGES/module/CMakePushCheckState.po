"This module defines three macros: ``CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE()`` "
"``CMAKE_POP_CHECK_STATE()`` and ``CMAKE_RESET_CHECK_STATE()`` These macros "
"can be used to save, restore and reset (i.e., clear contents) the state of "
"the variables ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``, ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``, "
"``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``, ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``, "
"``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES`` and ``CMAKE_EXTRA_INCLUDE_FILES`` used by the "
"various Check-files coming with CMake, like e.g. ``check_function_exists()`` "
"etc. The variable contents are pushed on a stack, pushing multiple times is "
"supported.  This is useful e.g.  when executing such tests in a Find-module, "
"where they have to be set, but after the Find-module has been executed they "
"should have the same value as they had before."

"``CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE()`` macro receives optional argument ``RESET``. "
"Whether it's specified, ``CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE()`` will set all "
"``CMAKE_REQUIRED_*`` variables to empty values, same as "
"``CMAKE_RESET_CHECK_STATE()`` call will do."
