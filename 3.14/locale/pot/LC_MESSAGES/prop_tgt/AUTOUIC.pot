":prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle the Qt "
"``uic`` code generator automatically, i.e. without having to use the :module:"
"`QT4_WRAP_UI() <FindQt4>` or ``QT5_WRAP_UI()`` macro. Currently Qt4 and Qt5 "
"are supported."

"When this property is ``ON``, CMake will scan the source files at build time "
"and invoke ``uic`` accordingly.  If an ``#include`` statement like "
"``#include \"ui_foo.h\"`` is found in ``source.cpp``, a ``foo.ui`` file is "
"searched for first in the vicinity of ``source.cpp`` and afterwards in the "
"optional :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS` of the target. ``uic`` is run on "
"the ``foo.ui`` file to generate ``ui_foo.h`` in the directory "
"``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/include``, which is automatically added to the "
"target's :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`."
