"CMake 3.10 and newer define that relative paths given to ``INPUT`` and "
"``OUTPUT`` arguments of ``file(GENERATE)`` are interpreted relative to the "
"current source and binary directories, respectively.  CMake 3.9 and lower "
"did not define any behavior for relative paths but did not diagnose them "
"either and accidentally treated them relative to the process working "
"directory. Policy ``CMP0070`` provides compatibility with projects that used "
"the old undefined behavior."

"This policy affects behavior of relative paths given to ``file(GENERATE)``. "
"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to treat the paths relative to the "
"working directory of CMake.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to "
"interpret relative paths with respect to the current source or binary "
"directory of the caller."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.10.  CMake version |release| "
"warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior. Use the :command:"
"`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-"
