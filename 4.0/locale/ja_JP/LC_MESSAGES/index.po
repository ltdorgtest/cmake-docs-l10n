"CMake is a tool to manage building of source code.  Originally, CMake was "
"designed as a generator for various dialects of ``Makefile``, today CMake "
"generates modern buildsystems such as ``Ninja`` as well as project files for "
"IDEs such as Visual Studio and Xcode."

"People encountering CMake for the first time may have different initial "
"goals.  To learn how to build a source code package downloaded from the "
"internet, start with the :guide:`User Interaction Guide`. This will detail "
"the steps needed to run the :manual:`cmake(1)` or :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` "
"executable and how to choose a generator, and how to complete the build."

"For developers starting a project using CMake, the :guide:`CMake Tutorial` "
"is a suitable starting point.  The :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)` manual is "
"aimed at developers expanding their knowledge of maintaining a buildsystem "
"and becoming familiar with the build targets that can be represented in "
"CMake.  The :manual:`cmake-packages(7)` manual explains how to create "
"packages which can easily be consumed by third-party CMake-based "
"buildsystems."
