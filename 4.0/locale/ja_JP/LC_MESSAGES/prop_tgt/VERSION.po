"For shared libraries ``VERSION`` and :prop_tgt:`SOVERSION` can be used to "
"specify the build version and ABI version respectively.  When building or "
"installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports "
"symlinks and the linker supports so-names.  If only one of both is specified "
"the missing is assumed to have the same version number.  For executables "
"``VERSION`` can be used to specify the build version.  When building or "
"installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports "
"symlinks."

"For shared libraries and executables on Mach-O systems (e.g. macOS, iOS), "
"the :prop_tgt:`SOVERSION` property corresponds to the *compatibility "
"version* and ``VERSION`` corresponds to the *current version* (unless Mach-O "
"specific overrides are provided, as discussed below). See the :prop_tgt:"
"`FRAMEWORK` target property for an example."
