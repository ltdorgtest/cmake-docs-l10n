"exports enabled, and the target has one or more ``PUBLIC`` or ``INTERFACE`` "
"header sets, an object library target named "

"target has one source file per header in the ``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` "
"header sets. Each source file only includes its associated header file. The "
"verification target links against the original target to get all of its "
"usage requirements. The verification target has its :prop_tgt:"
