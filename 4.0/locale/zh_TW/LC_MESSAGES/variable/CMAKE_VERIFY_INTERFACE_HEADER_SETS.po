"Projects should not normally set this variable, it is intended as a "
"developer control to be set on the :manual:`cmake(1)` command line or other "
"equivalent methods.  The developer must have the ability to enable or "
"disable header set verification according to the capabilities of their own "
"machine and compiler."

"Verification of a dependency's header sets is not typically of interest to "
"developers.  Therefore, :command:`FetchContent_MakeAvailable` explicitly "
"sets ``CMAKE_VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS`` to false for the duration of its "
"call, but restores its original value before returning.  If a project brings "
"a dependency directly into the main build (e.g. calling :command:"
"`add_subdirectory` on a vendored project from a git submodule), it should "
"also do likewise.  For example:"
