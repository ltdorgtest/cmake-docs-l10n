":prop_tgt:`IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED` was designed to make universal binaries "
"containing iOS/arm* device code paired with iOS Simulator/x86_64 code (or "
"similar for other Apple embedded platforms). Universal binaries can only "
"differentiate code based on CPU type, so this only made sense before the "
"days of arm64 macOS machines (i.e. iOS Simulator/arm64). Apple now "
"recommends xcframeworks, which contain multiple binaries for different "
"platforms, for this use case."

"When this property is set to false, which is the default, then it will "
"either be built with the device SDK or the simulator SDK depending on the "
"SDK set. But if this property is set to true then the target will at install "
"time also be built for the other SDK and combined into one library."
