"Specifies the build type on single-configuration generators (e.g. :ref:"
"`Makefile Generators` or :generator:`Ninja`).  Typical values include "
"``Debug``, ``Release``, ``RelWithDebInfo`` and ``MinSizeRel``, but custom "
"build types can also be defined."

"This variable is initialized by the first :command:`project` or :command:"
"`enable_language` command called in a project when a new build tree is first "
"created.  If the :envvar:`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` environment variable is set, its "
"value is used.  Otherwise, a toolchain-specific default is chosen when a "
"language is enabled.  The default value is often an empty string, but this "
"is usually not desirable and one of the other standard build types is "
"usually more appropriate."
