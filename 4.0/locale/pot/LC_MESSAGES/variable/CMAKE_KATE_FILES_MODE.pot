"When set to ``LIST``, CMake will put the list of source files known to CMake "
"in the project file. When set to ``SVN``, ``GIT``, ``HG`` or ``FOSSIL``, "
"CMake will set the generated project accordingly to Subversion, git, "
"Mercurial or Fossil, and Kate will then use the respective command line tool "
"to retrieve the list of files in the project. When unset or set to ``AUTO``, "
"CMake will try to detect whether the source directory is part of a git or "
"svn checkout or not, and put the respective entry into the project file."
