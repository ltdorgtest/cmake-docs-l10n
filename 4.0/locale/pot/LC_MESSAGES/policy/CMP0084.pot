"The existence of :module:`FindQt` means that for Qt upstream to provide "
"package config files that can be found by ``find_package(Qt)``, the "
"consuming project has to explicitly specify ``find_package(Qt CONFIG)``. "
"Removing this module gives Qt a path forward for exporting its own config "
"files which can easily be found by consuming projects."

"This policy pretends that CMake's internal :module:`FindQt` module does not "
