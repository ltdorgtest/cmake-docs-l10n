"Apart from when using the Xcode generator and some Visual Studio generators, "
"CMake 3.23 and below will set environment variables like :envvar:`CC`, :"
"envvar:`CXX`, etc. when the corresponding language is enabled. This only "
"occurs on the very first time CMake is run in a build directory, and the "
"environment variables are only defined at configure time, not build time. On "
"subsequent CMake runs, these environment variables are not set, opening up "
"the opportunity for different behavior between the first and subsequent "
"CMake runs. CMake 3.24 and above prefer to not set these environment "
"variables when a language is enabled, even on the first run in a build "
"directory."
