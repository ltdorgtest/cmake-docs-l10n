"CMake 3.0 and above recognize that Apple Clang is a different compiler than "
"upstream Clang and that they have different version numbers. CMake now "
"prefers to present this to projects by setting the :variable:"
"`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable to ``AppleClang`` instead of ``Clang``.  "
"However, existing projects may assume the compiler id for Apple Clang is "
"just ``Clang`` as it was in CMake versions prior to 3.0. Therefore this "
"policy determines for Apple Clang which compiler id to report in the :"
"variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable after language ``<LANG>`` is "
"enabled by the :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language` command.  "
"The policy must be set prior to the invocation of either command."
