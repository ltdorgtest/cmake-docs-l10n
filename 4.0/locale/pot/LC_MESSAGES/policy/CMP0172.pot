"The :cpack_gen:`CPack WIX Generator`'s :variable:`CPACK_WIX_INSTALL_SCOPE` "
"option controls the scope of the generated Windows Installer package. When :"
"variable:`CPACK_WIX_VERSION` is set to 4 or higher, the default scope is "
"``perMachine``.  However, when using WIX 3 the default scope is ``NONE``, "
"and CPack does not set any ``InstallScope`` in the package specification. "
"The resulting installer requires administrative privileges and installs into "
"the system-wide ``ProgramFiles`` directory, but the start menu entry and "
"uninstaller registration are created only for the current user."

"The :module:`CPack` module in CMake 3.30 and older does not specify any :"
"variable:`CPACK_WIX_INSTALL_SCOPE` value by default, so CPack uses no "
"installation scope by default with WIX 3.  CMake 3.31 and newer instead "
"prefer to set :variable:`CPACK_WIX_INSTALL_SCOPE` to ``perMachine`` by "
"default to make the behavior consistent across all WIX versions.  This "
"policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated to "
"expect ``perMachine`` behavior."
