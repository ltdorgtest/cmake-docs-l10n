"CMake's framework handling has evolved well beyond what the "
"``CMakeFindFrameworks`` module supports. The module lacks any handling of "
"XCFrameworks, it never documented the one command it provides, and :command:"
"`find_library` provides superior capabilities in all respects."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for :module:`CMakeFindFrameworks` to "
"continue to provide the undocumented ``cmake_find_frameworks()`` command. "
"The ``NEW`` behavior halts with a fatal error if anything tries to include "
"the module."
