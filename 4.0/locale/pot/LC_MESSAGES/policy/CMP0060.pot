"Policy :policy:`CMP0003` was introduced with the intention of always linking "
"library files by full path when a full path is given to the :command:"
"`target_link_libraries` command.  However, on some platforms (e.g. HP-UX) "
"the compiler front-end adds alternative library search paths for the current "
"architecture (e.g. ``/usr/lib/<arch>`` has alternatives to libraries in ``/"
"usr/lib`` for the current architecture). On such platforms the :command:"
"`find_library` may find a library such as ``/usr/lib/libfoo.so`` that does "
"not belong to the current architecture."

"Prior to policy :policy:`CMP0003` projects would still build in such cases "
"because the incorrect library path would be converted to ``-lfoo`` on the "
"link line and the linker would find the proper library in the arch-specific "
"search path provided by the compiler front-end implicitly. At the time we "
"chose to remain compatible with such projects by always converting library "
"files found in implicit link directories to ``-lfoo`` flags to ask the "
"linker to search for them.  This approach allowed existing projects to "
"continue to build while still linking to libraries outside implicit link "
"directories via full path (such as those in the build tree)."

"CMake does allow projects to override this behavior by using an :ref:"
"`IMPORTED library target <Imported Targets>` with its :prop_tgt:"
"`IMPORTED_LOCATION` property set to the desired full path to a library "
"file.  In fact, many :ref:`Find Modules` are learning to provide :ref:"
"`Imported Targets` instead of just the traditional ``Foo_LIBRARIES`` "
"variable listing library files.  However, this makes the link line generated "
"for a library found by a Find Module depend on whether it is linked through "
"an imported target or not, which is inconsistent. Furthermore, this behavior "
"has been a source of confusion because the generated link line for a library "
"file depends on its location.  It is also problematic for projects trying to "
"link statically because flags like ``-Wl,-Bstatic -lfoo -Wl,-Bdynamic`` may "
"be used to help the linker select ``libfoo.a`` instead of ``libfoo.so`` but "
"then leak dynamic linking to following libraries.  (See the :prop_tgt:"
"`LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC` target property for a solution typically used for "
"that problem.)"

"When the special case for libraries in implicit link directories was first "
"introduced the list of implicit link directories was simply hard-coded (e.g. "
"``/lib``, ``/usr/lib``, and a few others).  Since that time, CMake has "
"learned to detect the implicit link directories used by the compiler front-"
"end.  If necessary, the :command:`find_library` command could be taught to "
"use this information to help find libraries of the proper architecture."
