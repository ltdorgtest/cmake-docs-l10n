"CMake 3.1 introduced a much faster implementation of evaluation of the :ref:"
"`Variable References` and :ref:`Escape Sequences` documented in the :manual:"
"`cmake-language(7)` manual.  While the behavior is identical to the legacy "
"implementation in most cases, some corner cases were cleaned up to simplify "
"the behavior.  Specifically:"

"Literal ``${VAR}`` reference syntax may contain only alphanumeric characters "
"(``A-Z``, ``a-z``, ``0-9``) and the characters ``_``, ``.``, ``/``, ``-``, "
"and ``+``. Note that ``$`` is technically allowed in the ``NEW`` behavior, "
"but is invalid for ``OLD`` behavior.  This is due to an oversight during the "
"implementation of ``CMP0053`` and its use as a literal variable reference is "
"discouraged for this reason. Variables with other characters in their name "
"may still be referenced indirectly, e.g."
