"Compilers targeting the MSVC ABI have flags to select the debug information "
"format. Debug information format selection typically varies with build "
"configuration."

msgid ""
"In CMake 3.24 and below, debug information format flags are added to the "
"default :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>` cache entries by CMake "
"automatically.  This allows users to edit their cache entries to adjust the "
"flags.  However, the presence of such default flags is problematic for "
"projects that want to choose a different debug information format "
"programmatically.  In particular, it requires string editing of the :"
"variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>` variables with knowledge of the CMake "
"builtin defaults so they can be replaced."

msgid ""
"CMake 3.25 and above prefer to leave the debug information format flags out "
"of the default :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>` values and instead "
"offer a first-class abstraction.  The :variable:"
"`CMAKE_MSVC_DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT` variable and :prop_tgt:"
"`MSVC_DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT` target property may be set to select the "
"MSVC debug information format.  If they are not set, CMake enables debug "
"information in debug configurations using the default value ``$<$<CONFIG:"
"Debug,RelWithDebInfo>:ProgramDatabase>``, if supported by the compiler, and "
"otherwise ``$<$<CONFIG:Debug,RelWithDebInfo>:Embedded>``."

"This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated "
"to be aware of the abstraction.  The policy setting takes effect as of the "
"first :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language` command that enables "
"a language whose compiler targets the MSVC ABI."

"Once the policy has taken effect at the top of a project, that choice will "
"be used throughout the tree.  In projects that have nested projects in "
"subdirectories, be sure to confirm if everything is working with the "
"selected policy behavior."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to place MSVC debug information "
"format flags in the default :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>` cache "
"entries and ignore the :variable:`CMAKE_MSVC_DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT` "
"abstraction.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to *not* place MSVC "
"debug information format flags in the default cache entries and use the "
"abstraction instead."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. "
"It may be set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:"

"and uses ``OLD`` behavior."
