"The commands provide a ``GIT_SUBMODULES`` option which controls what "
"submodules to initialize and update. Starting with CMake 3.16, explicitly "
"setting ``GIT_SUBMODULES`` to an empty string means no submodules will be "
"initialized or updated."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is for ``GIT_SUBMODULES`` when set to "

"This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. "
"It may be set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:"
"`cmake_minimum_required`. If it is not set, CMake |WARNS_OR_DOES_NOT_WARN|, "
"and uses ``OLD`` behavior."

"This policy also applies to :command:`FetchContent_Declare`, which uses the "
"same download and update features as :command:`ExternalProject_Add`.  "
"However, due to an implementation deficiency present since the policy was "
"first introduced, CMake 3.16 and later always uses the ``NEW`` behavior for :"
"command:`FetchContent_Declare`, regardless of the policy setting. Formally, "
"this forcing of ``NEW`` behavior for :command:`FetchContent_Declare` will "
"continue to apply in future CMake releases."
