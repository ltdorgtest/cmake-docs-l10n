"where ``somelib`` is supposed to be a valid library file name such as "
"``libsomelib.a`` or ``somelib.lib``.  For Makefile generators this produces "
"an error at build time because the dependency on the full path cannot be "
"found.  For :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` IDE and :generator:`Xcode` "
"generators this used to work by accident because CMake would always split "
"off the library directory and ask the linker to search for the library by "
"name (``-lsomelib`` or ``somelib.lib``).  Despite the failure with "
"Makefiles, some projects have code like this and build only with Visual "
"Studio and/or Xcode. This version of CMake prefers to pass the full path "
"directly to the native build tool, which will fail in this case because it "
"does not name a valid library file."

"This policy determines what to do with full paths that do not appear to name "
"a valid library file.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to split the "
"library name from the path and ask the linker to search for it.  The ``NEW`` "
"behavior for this policy is to trust the given path and pass it directly to "
"the native build tool unchanged."
