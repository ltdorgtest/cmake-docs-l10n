"To pass options to the linker tool, each compiler driver has its own syntax. "
"The ``LINKER:`` prefix and ``,`` separator can be used to specify, in a "
"portable way, options to pass to the linker tool. ``LINKER:`` is replaced by "
"the appropriate driver option and ``,`` by the appropriate driver separator. "
"The driver prefix and driver separator are given by the values of the :"
"variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG` and :variable:"
"`CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP` variables."
