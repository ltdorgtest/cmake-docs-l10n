"The executable is run in the optionally specified directory.  The executable "
"can include arguments if it is double quoted, but it is better to use the "
"optional ``ARGS`` argument to specify arguments to the program.  This is "
"because cmake will then be able to escape spaces in the executable path.  An "
"optional argument ``OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` specifies a variable in which to store "
"the output.  To capture the return value of the execution, provide a "
"``RETURN_VALUE``.  If ``OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` is specified, then no output will "
"go to the stdout/stderr of the console running cmake."
