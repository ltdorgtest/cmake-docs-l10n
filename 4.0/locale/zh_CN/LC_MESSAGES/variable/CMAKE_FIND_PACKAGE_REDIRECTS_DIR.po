"This read-only variable specifies a directory that the :command:"
"`find_package` command will check first before searching anywhere else for a "
"module or config package file.  A config package file in this directory will "
"always be found in preference to any other Find module file or config "
"package file."

"The primary purpose of this variable is to facilitate integration between :"
"command:`find_package` and :command:`FetchContent_MakeAvailable`.  The "
"latter command may create files in the ``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR`` "
"directory when it populates a dependency.  This allows subsequent calls to :"
"command:`find_package` for the same dependency to reuse the populated "
"contents instead of trying to satisfy the dependency from somewhere external "
"to the build.  Projects may also want to write files into this directory in "
"some situations (see :ref:`FetchContent-find_package-integration-examples` "
"for examples)."

"The directory that ``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR`` points to will "
"always be erased and recreated empty at the start of every CMake run.  Any "
"files written into this directory during the CMake run will be lost the next "
"time CMake configures the project."
