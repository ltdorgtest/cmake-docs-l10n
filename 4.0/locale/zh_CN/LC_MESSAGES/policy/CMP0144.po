"In CMake 3.27 and above the :command:`find_package(<PackageName>)` command "
"now searches prefixes specified by the upper-case :variable:"
"`<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT` CMake variable and the :envvar:`<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT` "
"environment variable in addition to the case-preserved :variable:"
"`<PackageName>_ROOT` and :envvar:`<PackageName>_ROOT` variables used since "
"policy :policy:`CMP0074`. This policy provides compatibility with projects "
"that have not been updated to avoid using ``<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT`` variables "
"for other purposes."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore ``<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT`` "
