"When a ``VERSION <major>[.<minor>[.<patch>[.<tweak>]]]]`` argument is given "
"to the :command:`project` command, it stores the version string in the "
"``PROJECT_VERSION`` variable and stores individual integer version "
"components in ``PROJECT_VERSION_{MAJOR,MINOR,PATCH,TWEAK}`` variables (see "
"policy :policy:`CMP0048`).  CMake 3.15 and below dropped leading zeros from "
"each component.  CMake 3.16 and higher prefer to preserve leading zeros.  "
"This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated "
"to expect the new behavior."
