"The system directories that are contained in ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH`` "
"are locations that typically include installed software. An example being ``/"
"usr/local`` for UNIX based platforms. In addition to standard platform "
"locations, CMake will also add values to ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH`` based "
"on environment variables. The environment variables and search locations "
"that CMake uses may evolve over time, as platforms and their conventions "
"also evolve. The following provides an indicative list of environment "
"variables and locations that CMake searches, but they are subject to change:"
