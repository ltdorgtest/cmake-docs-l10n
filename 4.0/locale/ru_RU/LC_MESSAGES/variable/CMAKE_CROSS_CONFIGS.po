"Specifies a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of "
"configurations available from all ``build-<Config>.ninja`` files in the :"
"generator:`Ninja Multi-Config` generator.  This variable activates cross-"
"config mode. Targets from each config specified in this variable can be "
"built from any ``build-<Config>.ninja`` file. Custom commands will use the "
"configuration native to ``build-<Config>.ninja``. If it is set to ``all``, "
"all configurations from :variable:`CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES` are cross-"
"configs. If it is not specified, or empty, each ``build-<Config>.ninja`` "
"file will only contain build rules for its own configuration."
