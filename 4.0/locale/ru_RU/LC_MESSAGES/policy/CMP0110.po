":command:`add_test` can now (officially) create tests with whitespace and "
"other special characters in its name.  Before CMake version 3.19 that was "
"not allowed, however, it was possible to work around this limitation by "
"explicitly putting escaped quotes around the test's name in the ``add_test`` "
"command."

"Although never officially supported several projects in the wild found and "
"implemented this workaround.  However, the new change which officially "
"allows the ``add_test`` command to support whitespace and other special "
"characters in test names now breaks that workaround.  In order for these "
"projects to work smoothly with newer CMake versions, this policy was "
"introduced."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to still prevent ``add_test`` from "
"handling whitespace and special characters properly (if not using the "
"mentioned workaround).  The ``NEW`` behavior on the other hand allows names "
"with whitespace and special characters for tests created by ``add_test``."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. "
"It may be set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:"
"`cmake_minimum_required`. If it is not set, CMake |WARNS_OR_DOES_NOT_WARN|, "
"and uses ``OLD`` behavior."
