"Enable this boolean property if a generated ``SHARED`` library should not "
"have ``soname`` set.  Default is to set ``soname`` on all shared libraries "
"as long as the platform supports it. Generally, use this property only for "
"leaf private libraries or plugins.  If you use it on normal shared libraries "
"which other targets link against, on some platforms a linker will insert a "
"full path to the library (as specified at link time) into the dynamic "
"section of the dependent binary.  Therefore, once installed, dynamic loader "
"may eventually fail to locate the library for the binary."
