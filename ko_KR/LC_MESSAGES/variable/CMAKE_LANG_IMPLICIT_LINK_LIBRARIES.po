"Compilers typically pass language runtime library names and other flags when "
"they invoke a linker.  These flags are implicit link options for the "
"compiler's language.  For each language enabled by the :command:`project` "
"or :command:`enable_language` command, CMake automatically detects these "
"libraries and flags and reports the results in this variable."

"When linking to a static library, CMake adds the implicit link libraries and "
"flags from this variable for each language used in the static library "
"(except the language whose compiler is used to drive linking).  In the case "
"of an imported static library, the :prop_tgt:"
"`IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES` target property lists the languages "
"whose implicit link information is needed.  If any of the languages is not "
"enabled, its value for the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES`` variable "
"may instead be provided by the project.  Or, a :variable:`toolchain file "
"<CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>` may set the variable to a value known for the "
"specified toolchain.  It will either be overridden when the language is "
"enabled, or used as a fallback."
