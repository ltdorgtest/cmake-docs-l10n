"Specifies directories to be ignored by searches in FIND_XXX() commands.  "
"This is useful in cross-compiled environments where some system directories "
"contain incompatible but possibly linkable libraries.  For example, on cross-"
"compiled cluster environments, this allows a user to ignore directories "
"containing libraries meant for the front-end machine that modules like "
"FindX11 (and others) would normally search.  By default this is empty; it is "
"intended to be set by the project.  Note that CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH takes a list "
"of directory names, NOT a list of prefixes.  If you want to ignore paths "
"under prefixes (bin, include, lib, etc.), you'll need to specify them "
"explicitly.  See also CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH, "
"CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH."
