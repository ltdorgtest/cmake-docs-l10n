"Some CMake generators support selection of an instance of the native build "
"system when multiple instances are available.  If the user specifies an "
"instance (e.g. by setting this cache entry), or after a default instance is "
"chosen when a build tree is first configured, the value will be available in "
"this variable."

"The value of this variable should never be modified by project code. A "
"toolchain file specified by the :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` variable "

"build tree has been initialized with a particular value for this variable, "
"changing the value has undefined behavior."
