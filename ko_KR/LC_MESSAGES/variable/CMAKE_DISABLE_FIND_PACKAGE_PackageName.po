"Every non-``REQUIRED`` :command:`find_package` call in a project can be "
"disabled by setting the variable "
"``CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>`` to ``TRUE``. This can be used "
"to build a project without an optional package, although that package is "
"installed."

"This switch should be used during the initial CMake run.  Otherwise if the "
"package has already been found in a previous CMake run, the variables which "
"have been stored in the cache will still be there.  In that case it is "
"recommended to remove the cache variables for this package from the cache "
"using the cache editor or :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-U``"
