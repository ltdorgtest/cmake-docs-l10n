"A property on a target that indicates if the target is excluded from the "
"default build target.  If it is not, then with a Makefile for example typing "
"make will cause this target to be built.  The same concept applies to the "
"default build of other generators.  Installing a target with "
"EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true has undefined behavior."
