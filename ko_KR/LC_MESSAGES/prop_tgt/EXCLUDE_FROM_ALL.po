"Set this target property to a true (or false) value to exclude (or include) "
"the target from the \"all\" target of the containing directory and its "
"ancestors.  If excluded, running e.g. ``make`` in the containing directory "
"or its ancestors will not build the target by default."

"If this target property is not set then the target will be included in the "
"\"all\" target of the containing directory.  Furthermore, it will be "
"included in the \"all\" target of its ancestor directories unless the :"
"prop_dir:`EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL` directory property is set."

msgid ""
"With ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` set to false or not set at all, the target will be "
"brought up to date as part of doing a ``make install`` or its equivalent for "
"the CMake generator being used.  If a target has ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` set to "
"true, then any attempt to install that target has undefined behavior.  Note "
"that such a target can still safely be listed in an :command:"
"`install(TARGETS)` command as long as the install components the target "
"belongs to are not part of the set of components that anything tries to "
"install."
