"Normally an executable does not export any symbols because it is the final "
"program.  It is possible for an executable to export symbols to be used by "
"loadable modules.  When this property is set to true CMake will allow other "
"targets to \"link\" to the executable with the :command:"
"`TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES` command.  On all platforms a target-level dependency "
"on the executable is created for targets that link to it. For DLL platforms "
"an import library will be created for the exported symbols and then used for "
"linking.  All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.  For "
"non-DLL platforms that require all symbols to be resolved at link time, such "
"as OS X, the module will \"link\" to the executable using a flag like ``-"
"bundle_loader``.  For other non-DLL platforms the link rule is simply "
"ignored since the dynamic loader will automatically bind symbols when the "
"module is loaded."
