"This is a per-configuration version of :prop_tgt:`PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`, but "
"multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) do NOT append a per-configuration "
"subdirectory to the specified directory.  This property is initialized by "
"the value of the :variable:`CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>` variable if "
"it is set when a target is created."

"This property does not apply to STATIC library targets because no linker is "
"invoked to produce them so they have no linker-generated ``.pdb`` file "
"containing debug symbols."

msgid ""
"The linker-generated program database files are specified by the ``/pdb`` "
"linker flag and are not the same as compiler-generated program database "
"files specified by the ``/Fd`` compiler flag. Use the |COMPILE_PDB_XXX| "
"property to specify the latter."
