"If Qt 5.15 or later is used and the generator is either :generator:`Ninja` "

"Targets which have their :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` or :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` property "
"``ON`` have a corresponding :ref:`<ORIGIN>_autogen` target which generates "
"``moc`` and ``uic`` files.  As this :ref:`<ORIGIN>_autogen` target is "
"created at generate-time, it is not possible to define dependencies of it "
"using e.g.  :command:`add_dependencies`.  Instead the "
"``AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS`` target property decides whether the origin target "
"dependencies should be forwarded to the :ref:`<ORIGIN>_autogen` target or "
"not."
