"This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be "
"used.  For some compilers, this results in adding a flag such as ``-"
"std=gnu11`` instead of ``-std=c11`` to the compile line.  This property is "
"``ON`` by default. The basic C standard level is controlled by the :prop_tgt:"
"`C_STANDARD` target property."
