"For a non-imported target, this property is provided for compatibility with "
"CMake 2.4 and below.  It was meant to get the location of an executable "
"target's output file for use in add_custom_command.  The path may contain a "
"build-system-specific portion that is replaced at build time with the "
"configuration getting built (such as \"$(ConfigurationName)\" in VS).  In "
"CMake 2.6 and above add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target "
"name in its COMMAND and DEPENDS options and computes the target location.  "
"In CMake 2.8.4 and above add_custom_command recognizes generator expressions "
"to refer to target locations anywhere in the command. Therefore this "
"property is not needed for creating custom commands."

"Do not set properties that affect the location of a target after reading "
"this property.  These include properties whose names match \"(RUNTIME|"
"LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_<CONFIG>)?\", ``(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|"
"SUFFIX)``, or \"LINKER_LANGUAGE\".  Failure to follow this rule is not "
"diagnosed and leaves the location of the target undefined."
