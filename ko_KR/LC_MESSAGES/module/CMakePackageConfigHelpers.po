"The ``COMPATIBILITY`` mode ``AnyNewerVersion`` means that the installed "
"package version will be considered compatible if it is newer or exactly the "
"same as the requested version.  This mode should be used for packages which "
"are fully backward compatible, also across major versions. If "
"``SameMajorVersion`` is used instead, then the behaviour differs from "
"``AnyNewerVersion`` in that the major version number must be the same as "
"requested, e.g.  version 2.0 will not be considered compatible if 1.0 is "
"requested.  This mode should be used for packages which guarantee backward "
"compatibility within the same major version. If ``ExactVersion`` is used, "
"then the package is only considered compatible if the requested version "
"matches exactly its own version number (not considering the tweak version).  "
"For example, version 1.2.3 of a package is only considered compatible to "
"requested version 1.2.3.  This mode is for packages without compatibility "
"guarantees. If your project has more elaborated version matching rules, you "
"will need to write your own custom ``ConfigVersion.cmake`` file instead of "
"using this macro."

"internal to CMake and you should not call :command:`configure_file()` on "
"them yourself, but they can be used as starting point to create more "
