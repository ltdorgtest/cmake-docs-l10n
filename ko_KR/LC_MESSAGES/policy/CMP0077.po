"The :command:`option` command is typically used to create a cache entry to "
"allow users to set the option.  However, there are cases in which a normal "
"(non-cached) variable of the same name as the option may be defined by the "
"project prior to calling the :command:`option` command. For example, a "
"project that embeds another project as a subdirectory may want to hard-code "
"options of the subproject to build the way it needs."

"In both of these cases (typically on the first run in a new build tree), "
"the :command:`option` command gives the cache entry type ``BOOL`` and "
"removes any normal (non-cached) variable of the same name.  In the remaining "
"case that the cache entry of the specified name already exists and has a "
"type (typically on later runs in a build tree), the :command:`option` "
"command changes nothing and any normal variable of the same name remains set."

"In CMake 3.13 and above the :command:`option` command prefers to do nothing "
"when a normal variable of the given name already exists. It does not create "
"or update a cache entry or remove the normal variable. The new behavior is "
"consistent between the first and later runs in a build tree.  This policy "
"provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated to expect "
"the new behavior."
