"CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed a signature for :command:`add_custom_command` "
"which specified an input to a command.  This was undocumented behavior. "
"Modern use of CMake associates custom commands with their output, rather "
"than their input."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow the use of :command:"
"`add_custom_command` SOURCE signatures.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this "
"policy is to issue an error if such a signature is used."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. "
"Prior to removal in CMake version |REMOVED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|, it could be "
"set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:`cmake_minimum_required`. If it "
"was not set, CMake |WARNED_OR_DID_NOT_WARN|, and used ``OLD`` behavior."
