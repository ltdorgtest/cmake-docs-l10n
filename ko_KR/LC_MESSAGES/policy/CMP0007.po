"This policy determines whether the list command will ignore empty elements "
"in the list.  CMake 2.4 and below list commands ignored all empty elements "
"in the list.  For example, a;b;;c would have length 3 and not 4.  The OLD "
"behavior for this policy is to ignore empty list elements.  The NEW behavior "
"for this policy is to correctly count empty elements in a list."

"warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use the "
