"CMake 2.8.10 and lower re-evaluated values given to the include_directories, "
"link_directories, and link_libraries commands to expand any leftover "
"variable references at the end of the configuration step.  This was for "
"strict compatibility with VERY early CMake versions because all variable "
"references are now normally evaluated during CMake language processing.  "
"CMake 2.8.11 and higher prefer to skip the extra evaluation."

"The OLD behavior for this policy is to re-evaluate the values for strict "
