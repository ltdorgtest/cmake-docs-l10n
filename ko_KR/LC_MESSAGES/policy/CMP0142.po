"The :generator:`Xcode` generator does not append per-config suffixes to "

msgid ""
"In CMake 3.24 and below, the :generator:`Xcode` generator preceded each "
"entry of a library search path with a copy of itself appended with "
"``$(CONFIGURATION)$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME)``.  This was left from very "
"early versions of CMake in which per-config directories were not well "
"modeled.  Such paths often do not exist, resulting in warnings from the "
"toolchain.  CMake 3.25 and above prefer to not add such library search "
"paths.  This policy provides compatibility for projects that may have been "
"accidentally relying on the old behavior."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to append "

"It may be set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:"
"`cmake_minimum_required`. If it is not set, CMake |WARNS_OR_DOES_NOT_WARN|, "
"and uses ``OLD`` behavior."
