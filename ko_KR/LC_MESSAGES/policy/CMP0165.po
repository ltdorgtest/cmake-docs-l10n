"In CMake 3.29 and below, if a project called :command:`enable_language` "
"before the first call to :command:`project`, the language would be enabled "
"but possibly using unset details that were expected to be set. In CMake 3.30 "
"and above, :command:`enable_language` prefers to reject this case and stop "
"with a fatal error instead if it detects that :command:`project` has not yet "
"been called.  This policy provides compatibility for projects that happened "
"to work when :command:`enable_language` was called before :command:`project` "
"and have not been updated to call these commands in the required order."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow :command:`enable_language` "
