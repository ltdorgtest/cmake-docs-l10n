"Visual Studio Generators select a Windows SDK version to put in the "
"``WindowsTargetPlatformVersion`` setting in ``.vcxproj`` files. CMake sets "
"the :variable:`CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION` variable to the "
"selected SDK version."

"Prior to CMake 3.27, the SDK version was always selected by the value of "
"the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION` variable.  Users or toolchain files "
"could set that variable to one of the exact Windows SDK versions available "
"on the host system.  Since :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION` defaults to :"
"variable:`CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION`, and it is not guaranteed that a "
"matching Windows SDK version is available, CMake had to fall back to using "
"the latest Windows SDK version if no exact match was available. This "
"approach was problematic:"
