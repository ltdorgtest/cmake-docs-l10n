"directory to be in the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of "
"installed and exported targets, if the directory was also a subdirectory of "
"the installation prefix.  This makes the installation depend on the "
"existence of the source dir or binary dir, and the installation will be "
"broken if either are removed after installation."
