"The :module:`GNUInstallDirs` module documents :ref:`special cases "
"<GNUInstallDirs special cases>` for ``SYSCONFDIR``, ``LOCALSTATEDIR``, and "
"``RUNSTATEDIR``. When :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is a special prefix, "

"In CMake 4.0 and below, the default values for the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>`` "
"variables, for ``<dir>`` equal to ``SYSCONFDIR``, ``LOCALSTATEDIR``, and "
"``RUNSTATEDIR``, always used relative paths (``etc``, ``var``, ``var/run``), "
"and the special cases were implemented only when computing absolute paths "
"for the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_<dir>`` variables. CMake 4.1 and above prefer "
"to default ``CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>`` variables to absolute paths, for "
"``<dir>`` equal to ``SYSCONFDIR``, ``LOCALSTATEDIR``, and ``RUNSTATEDIR``, "
"when :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is a special prefix.  This policy "
"provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated to expect "
"this behavior."
