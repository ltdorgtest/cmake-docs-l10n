"Boolean environment variable that affects how :manual:`ctest <ctest(1)>` "
"command output reports overall progress.  When set to ``1``, ``TRUE``, "
"``ON`` or anything else that evaluates to boolean true, progress is reported "
"by repeatedly updating the same line.  This greatly reduces the overall "
"verbosity, but is only supported when output is sent directly to a "
"terminal.  If the environment variable is not set or has a value that "
"evaluates to false, output is reported normally with each test having its "
"own start and end lines logged to the output."
