"Loads the cache file from the specified ``<build-dir>`` build directory and "
"retrieves the listed cache entries.  The retrieved values are stored in "

"This form loads the cache file from the specified ``<build-dir>`` build "

"Instead of loading the outside project's cache file and manually accessing "
"variables, a more robust and convenient approach is to use the :command:"
"`export` command in the outside project, when available.  This allows the "
"project to provide its targets, configuration, or features in a structured "
