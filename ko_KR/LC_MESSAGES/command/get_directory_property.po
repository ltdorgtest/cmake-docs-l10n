"The ``DIRECTORY`` argument specifies another directory from which to "
"retrieve the property value instead of the current directory. It may "
"reference either a source directory, or since CMake 3.19, a binary "
"directory.  Relative paths are treated as relative to the current source "
"directory.  CMake must already know about the directory, either by having "
"added it through a call to :command:`add_subdirectory` or being the top "
"level directory."
