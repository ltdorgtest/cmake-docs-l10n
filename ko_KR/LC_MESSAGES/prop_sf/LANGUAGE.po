"A property that can be set to indicate what programming language the source "
"file is.  If it is not set the language is determined based on the file "
"extension.  Typical values are ``CXX`` (i.e.  C++), ``C``, ``CSharp``, "
"``CUDA``, ``Fortran``, and ``ASM``.  Setting this property for a file means "
"this file will be compiled.  Do not set this for headers or files that "
"should not be compiled."
