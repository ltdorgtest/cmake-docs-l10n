":ref:`Semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories to be "
"*ignored* by the :command:`find_program`, :command:`find_library`, :command:"
"`find_file`, and :command:`find_path` commands.  This is useful in cross-"
"compiling environments where some system directories contain incompatible "
"but possibly linkable libraries.  For example, on cross-compiled cluster "
"environments, this allows a user to ignore directories containing libraries "
"meant for the front-end machine."

"By default this is empty; it is intended to be set by the project. Note that "
"``CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH`` takes a list of directory names, *not* a list of "
"prefixes.  To ignore paths under prefixes (``bin``, ``include``, ``lib``, "
"etc.), specify them explicitly."
