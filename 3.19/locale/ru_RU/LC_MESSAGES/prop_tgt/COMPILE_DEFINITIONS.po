"Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping certain "
"values.  CMake has work-arounds for many cases but some values may just not "
"be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem to be escaped "
"correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape "
"sequences to the value.  Your work-around may break in a future version of "
"CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead consider defining the macro "
"in a (configured) header file.  Then report the limitation.  Known "
"limitations include::"
