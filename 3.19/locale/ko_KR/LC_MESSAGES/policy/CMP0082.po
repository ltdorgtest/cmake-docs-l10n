"CMake 3.13 and lower ran the install rules from :command:`add_subdirectory` "
"after all other install rules, even if :command:`add_subdirectory` was "
"called before the other install rules.  CMake 3.14 and above prefer to "
"interleave these :command:`add_subdirectory` install rules with the others "
"so that they are run in the order they are declared.  This policy provides "
"compatibility for projects that have not been updated to expect the new "
"behavior."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.14.  Unlike most policies, "
"CMake version |release| does *not* warn by default when this policy is not "
"set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.  See documentation of the :variable:"
"`CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0082 <CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP<NNNN>>` variable to "
"control the warning."
