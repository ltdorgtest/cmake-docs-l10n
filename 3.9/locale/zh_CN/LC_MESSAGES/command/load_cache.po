"Load in the values from another cache and store them in the local project's "
"cache as internal entries.  This is useful for a project that depends on "
"another project built in a different tree.  ``EXCLUDE`` option can be used "
"to provide a list of entries to be excluded. ``INCLUDE_INTERNALS`` can be "
"used to provide a list of internal entries to be included.  Normally, no "
"internal entries are brought in.  Use of this form of the command is "
"strongly discouraged, but it is provided for backward compatibility."
