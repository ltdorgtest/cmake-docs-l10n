"As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will always "
"be set to the one currently being processed.  The value has dynamic scope.  "
"When CMake starts processing commands in a source file it sets this variable "
"to the location of the file.  When CMake finishes processing commands from "
"the file it restores the previous value.  Therefore the value of the "
"variable inside a macro or function is the file invoking the bottom-most "
"entry on the call stack, not the file containing the macro or function "
"definition."
