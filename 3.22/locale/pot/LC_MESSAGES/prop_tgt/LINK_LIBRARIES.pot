"Contents of ``LINK_LIBRARIES`` may use \"generator expressions\" with the "

"A call to :command:`target_link_libraries(<target> ...)` may update this "
"property on ``<target>``.  If ``<target>`` was not created in the same "
"directory as the call then :command:`target_link_libraries` will wrap each "
"entry with the form ``::@(directory-id);...;::@``, where the ``::@`` is "
"literal and the ``(directory-id)`` is unspecified. This tells the generators "
"that the named libraries must be looked up in the scope of the caller rather "
"than in the scope in which the ``<target>`` was created.  Valid directory "
"ids are stripped on export by the :command:`install(EXPORT)` and :command:"
"`export` commands."
