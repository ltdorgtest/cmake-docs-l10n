":ref:`Imported Targets` for library files and executables require that their "
"location on disk is specified in a target property such as :prop_tgt:"
"`IMPORTED_LOCATION`, :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_IMPLIB`, or a per-configuration "
"equivalent.  If a needed location property is not set, CMake 3.18 and below "
"generate the string ``<TARGET_NAME>-NOTFOUND`` in its place, which results "
"in failures of the corresponding rules at build time.  CMake 3.19 and above "
"prefer instead to raise an error during generation.  This policy provides "
"compatibility for projects that have not been updated to expect the new "
"behavior."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to generate the location of an "
"imported unknown, static or shared library target as ``<TARGET_NAME>-"
"NOTFOUND`` if not set. The ``NEW`` behavior is to raise an error."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.19.  CMake version |release| "
"warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior. Use the :command:"
"`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-"
