"The ``INTERFACE``, ``PUBLIC`` and ``PRIVATE`` keywords are required to "
"specify the scope of the items following them.  ``PRIVATE`` and ``PUBLIC`` "
"items will populate the :prop_tgt:`SOURCES` property of ``<target>``, which "
"are used when building the target itself. ``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` items "
"will populate the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_SOURCES` property of ``<target>``, "
"which are used when building dependents. The following arguments specify "
"sources.  Repeated calls for the same ``<target>`` append items in the order "
"called. The targets created by :command:`add_custom_target` can only have "
"``PRIVATE`` scope."
