"Set this directory property to a true value on a subdirectory to exclude its "
"targets from the \"all\" target of its ancestors.  If excluded, running e.g. "
"``make`` in the parent directory will not build targets the subdirectory by "
"default.  This does not affect the \"all\" target of the subdirectory "
"itself.  Running e.g. ``make`` inside the subdirectory will still build its "
"targets."
