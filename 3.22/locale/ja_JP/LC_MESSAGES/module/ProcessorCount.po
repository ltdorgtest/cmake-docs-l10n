"This function is intended to offer an approximation of the value of the "
"number of compute cores available on the current machine, such that you may "
"use that value for parallel building and parallel testing.  It is meant to "
"help utilize as much of the machine as seems reasonable.  Of course, "
"knowledge of what else might be running on the machine simultaneously should "
"be used when deciding whether to request a machine's full capacity all for "
"yourself."
