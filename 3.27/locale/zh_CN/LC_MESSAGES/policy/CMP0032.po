"This command was added in June 2001 to expose the then-current CMake "
"implicit dependency scanner.  CMake's real implicit dependency scanner has "
"evolved since then but is not exposed through this command.  The scanning "
"capabilities of this command are very limited and this functionality is "
"better achieved through dedicated outside tools."

"CMake >= |disallowed_version| prefer that this command never be called. The "
"``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow the command to be called. The "
"``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to issue a ``FATAL_ERROR`` when the "
"command is called."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version |disallowed_version|. CMake "
"version |release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` "
"behavior.  Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or "
"``NEW`` explicitly."
