"CTestUseLaunchers is automatically included when you include(CTest). "

"To use launchers, set CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS to ON in a :option:`ctest -S` "
"dashboard script, and then also set it in the cache of the configured "
"project.  Both cmake and ctest need to know the value of it for the "
"launchers to work properly.  CMake needs to know in order to generate proper "
"build rules, and ctest, in order to produce the proper error and warning "
"analysis."

"For convenience, you may set the ENV variable CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS_DEFAULT in "
"your ctest -S script, too.  Then, as long as your CMakeLists uses "
"include(CTest) or include(CTestUseLaunchers), it will use the value of the "
"ENV variable to initialize a CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS cache variable.  This cache "
"variable initialization only occurs if CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is not already "
"defined."
