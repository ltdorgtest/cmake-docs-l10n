"If the header files define the symbol as a macro it is considered available "
"and assumed to work.  If the header files declare the symbol as a function "
"or variable then the symbol must also be available for linking.  If the "
"symbol is a type, enum value, or C++ template it will not be recognized: "
"consider using the :module:`CheckTypeSize` or :module:`CheckSourceCompiles` "

"This command is unreliable when ``<symbol>`` is (potentially) an overloaded "

"in the system environment may be defined as an overloaded function or may be "
"an overloaded function on other systems or will become so in the future, it "
"is generally advised to use the :module:`CheckCXXSourceCompiles` module for "
"checking any function symbol (unless somehow you surely know the checked "
"function is not overloaded on other systems or will not be so in the future)."
