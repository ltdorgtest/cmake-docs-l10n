"In CMake 3.18 and lower, the Makefile generators put a copy of both custom "
"commands in the Makefile for target ``second`` even though its dependency on "
"target ``first`` ensures that the first custom command runs before the "
"second. Running ``make second`` would cause the first custom command to run "
"once in the ``first`` target and then again in the ``second`` target."

"CMake 3.19 and above prefer to not duplicate custom commands in a target "
"that are already generated in other targets on which the target depends "
"(directly or indirectly).  This policy provides compatibility for projects "
"that have not been updated to expect the new behavior.  In particular, "
"projects that relied on the duplicate execution or that did not properly set "
"the :prop_sf:`SYMBOLIC` source file property may be affected."
