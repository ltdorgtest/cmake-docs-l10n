"In CMake 3.14 and below the module would report the Boost version number as "
"specified in the preprocessor definition ``BOOST_VERSION`` in the ``boost/"
"version.hpp`` file. In CMake 3.15 and later it is preferred that the "
"reported version number matches the ``x.y.z`` format reported by the CMake "
"package shipped with Boost ``1.70.0`` and later. The macro value is still "
"reported in the ``Boost_VERSION_MACRO`` variable."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is for :module:`FindBoost` to report "
"``Boost_VERSION`` as specified in the preprocessor definition "
"``BOOST_VERSION`` in ``boost/version.hpp``. The ``NEW`` behavior for this "
"policy is for :module:`FindBoost` to report ``Boost_VERSION`` in ``x.y.z`` "

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.15.  Use the :command:"
"`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly. Unlike "
"many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn when this policy is "
"not set and simply uses the ``OLD`` behavior."
