"Specify a directory for the ``clang-tidy`` tool to put ``.yaml`` files "
"containing its suggested changes in. This can be used for automated mass "
"refactoring by ``clang-tidy``. Each object file that gets compiled will have "
"a corresponding ``.yaml`` file in this directory. After the build is "
"completed, you can run ``clang-apply-replacements`` on this directory to "
"simultaneously apply all suggested changes to the code base. If this "
"property is not an absolute directory, it is assumed to be relative to the "
"target's binary directory. This property should be preferred over adding an "
"``--export-fixes`` or ``--fix`` argument directly to the :prop_tgt:"
"`<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY` property."

"When this property is set, CMake takes ownership of the specified directory, "
"and may create, modify, or delete files and directories within the directory "
"at any time during configure or build time. Users should use a dedicated "
"directory for exporting clang-tidy fixes to avoid having files deleted or "
"overwritten by CMake. Users should not create, modify, or delete files in "
"this directory."
