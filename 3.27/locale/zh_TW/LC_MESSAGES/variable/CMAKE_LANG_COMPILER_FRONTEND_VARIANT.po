"Some compilers have multiple, different frontends for accepting command line "
"options.  (For example ``Clang`` originally only had a frontend compatible "
"with the ``GNU`` compiler but since its port to Windows (``Clang-Cl``) it "
"now also supports a frontend compatible with ``MSVC``.) When CMake detects "
"such a compiler it sets this variable to what would have been the :variable:"
"`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` for the compiler whose frontend it resembles."
