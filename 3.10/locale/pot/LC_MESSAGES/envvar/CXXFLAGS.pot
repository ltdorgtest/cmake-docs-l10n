"Default compilation flags to be used when compiling ``CXX`` (C++) files. "
"Will only be used by CMake on the first configuration to determine ``CXX`` "
"default compilation flags, after which the value for ``CXXFLAGS`` is stored "
"in the cache as :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>`. For any "
"configuration run ( including the first), the environment variable will be "
"ignored if the :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>` variable is "
