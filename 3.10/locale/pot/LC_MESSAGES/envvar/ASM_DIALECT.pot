"Preferred executable for compiling a specific dialect of assembly language "
"files. ``ASM<DIALECT>`` can be ``ASM``, ``ASM_NASM``, ``ASM_MASM`` or ``ASM-"
"ATT``. Will only be used by CMake on the first configuration to determine "
"``ASM<DIALECT>`` compiler, after which the value for ``ASM<DIALECT>`` is "
"stored in the cache as :variable:`CMAKE_ASM<DIALECT>_COMPILER "
"<CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER>`. For subsequent configuration runs, the environment "
"variable will be ignored in favor of :variable:`CMAKE_ASM<DIALECT>_COMPILER "
"<CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER>`."
