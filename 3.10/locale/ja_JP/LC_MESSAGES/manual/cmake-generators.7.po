"A *CMake Generator* is responsible for writing the input files for a native "
"build system.  Exactly one of the `CMake Generators`_ must be selected for a "
"build tree to determine what native build system is to be used.  Optionally "
"one of the `Extra Generators`_ may be selected as a variant of some of the "
"`Command-Line Build Tool Generators`_ to produce project files for an "
"auxiliary IDE."

"CMake Generators are platform-specific so each may be available only on "
"certain platforms.  The :manual:`cmake(1)` command-line tool ``--help`` "
"output lists available generators on the current platform.  Use its ``-G`` "
"option to specify the generator for a new build tree. The :manual:`cmake-"
"gui(1)` offers interactive selection of a generator when creating a new "
"build tree."
