"This policy determines whether or not CMake should generate escaped "
"preprocessor definition values added via add_definitions.  CMake versions "
"2.4 and below assumed that only trivial values would be given for macros in "
"add_definitions calls.  It did not attempt to escape non-trivial values such "
"as string literals in generated build rules. CMake versions 2.6 and above "
"support escaping of most values, but cannot assume the user has not added "
"escapes already in an attempt to work around limitations in earlier versions."

"The OLD behavior for this policy is to place definition values given to "
"add_definitions directly in the generated build rules without attempting to "
"escape anything.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to generate correct "
"escapes for all native build tools automatically. See documentation of the "
"COMPILE_DEFINITIONS target property for limitations of the escaping "
"implementation."
