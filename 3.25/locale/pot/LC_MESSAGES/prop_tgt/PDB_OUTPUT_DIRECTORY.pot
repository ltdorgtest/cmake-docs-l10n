"This property specifies the directory into which the MS debug symbols will "
"be placed by the linker. The property value may use :manual:`generator "

"generators append a per-configuration subdirectory to the specified "
"directory unless a generator expression is used."

"This property does not apply to STATIC library targets because no linker is "
"invoked to produce them so they have no linker-generated ``.pdb`` file "

"property to specify the latter."
