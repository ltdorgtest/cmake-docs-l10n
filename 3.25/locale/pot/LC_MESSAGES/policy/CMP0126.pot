"When this policy is set to ``NEW``, the :command:`set(CACHE)` command does "

"A cache variable of that name existed previously, but it had no type. This "
"can occur when the variable was set on the command line using a form like "
"``cmake -DMYVAR=blah`` instead of ``cmake -DMYVAR:STRING=blah``."

"Note that the ``NEW`` behavior has an important difference to the similar "
"``NEW`` behavior of policy :policy:`CMP0077`.  The :command:`set(CACHE)` "
"command always sets the cache variable if it did not exist previously, "
"regardless of the ``CMP0126`` policy setting.  The :command:`option` command "
"will *not* set the cache variable if a non-cache variable of the same name "
"already exists and :policy:`CMP0077` is set to ``NEW``."

"Policy ``CMP0126`` was introduced in CMake version 3.21. Use the :command:"
"`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly within a "
"project.  Use the :variable:`CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP0126 "
"<CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP\\<NNNN\\>>` variable to set the policy for a third-"
"party project in a subdirectory without modifying it. Unlike many policies, "
"CMake version |release| does *not* warn when the policy is not set and "
"simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.  See documentation of the :variable:"
"`CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0126 <CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP<NNNN>>` variable to "
"control the warning."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-"
