"The :module:`CheckIPOSupported` module :command:`check_ipo_supported` "
"command compiles a test project to determine whether the toolchain supports :"
"prop_tgt:`INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION`.  CMake 3.23 and below run the check "
"with the default values of the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` and :variable:"
"`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>` variables for the current environment and "
"toolchain settings. However, some projects may modify these flag variables "
"to add flags that affect availability of the toolchain's IPO features. CMake "
"3.24 and above prefer to honor the calling project's values for these "
"variables.  This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not "
"been updated to expect this behavior."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore the calling project's "
"values of :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` and :variable:"
"`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>`.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to "
"use the values of those variables as compiler flags in the test project."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.24. Use the :command:"
"`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly. Unlike "
"many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn when this policy is "
"not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior."

#: ../../../policy/DEPRECATED.txt:2
msgid ""
"The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-"
"policies(7)>` and may be removed in a future version of CMake."
