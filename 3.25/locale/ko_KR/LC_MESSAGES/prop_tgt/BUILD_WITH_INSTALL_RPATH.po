"``BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH`` is a boolean specifying whether to link the "
"target in the build tree with the :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_RPATH`.  This takes "
"precedence over :prop_tgt:`SKIP_BUILD_RPATH` and avoids the need for "
"relinking before installation."

"If policy :policy:`CMP0068` is not ``NEW``, this property also controls use "
"of :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_NAME_DIR` in the build tree on macOS.  Either way, "
