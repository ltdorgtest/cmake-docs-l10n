"When using MSVC-like compilers in CMake 3.19 and below, the RTTI flag ``/"
"GR`` is added to :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>` by "
"default.  This behavior is left from support for MSVC versions from Visual "
"Studio 2003 and below that did not enable RTTI by default.  It is no longer "
"necessary.  Furthermore, it is problematic for projects that want to change "
"to ``/GR-`` programmatically.  In particular, it requires string editing of "
"the :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>` variable with knowledge "
"of the CMake builtin default so it can be replaced."

"This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated "
"to expect the lack of the ``/GR`` flag.  The policy setting takes effect as "
"of the first :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language` command that "
"initializes :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>`."

"Once the policy has taken effect at the top of a project for a given "
