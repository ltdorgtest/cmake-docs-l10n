"CMake will end its processing of the current file at the location of the "
"``include_guard`` command if the current file has already been processed for "
"the applicable scope (see below). This provides functionality similar to the "
"include guards commonly used in source headers or to the ``#pragma once`` "
"directive. If the current file has been processed previously for the "
"applicable scope, the effect is as though :command:`return` had been called. "
"Do not call this command from inside a function being defined within the "
"current file."

"An optional argument specifying the scope of the guard may be provided. "

"The include guard applies within the current directory and below. The file "
"will only be included once within this directory scope, but may be included "
"again by other files outside of this directory (i.e. a parent directory or "
"another directory not pulled in by :command:`add_subdirectory` or :command:"
"`include` from the current file or its children)."

"If no arguments given, ``include_guard`` has the same scope as a variable, "
"meaning that the include guard effect is isolated by the most recent "
"function scope or current directory if no inner function scopes exist. In "
"this case the command behavior is the same as:"
