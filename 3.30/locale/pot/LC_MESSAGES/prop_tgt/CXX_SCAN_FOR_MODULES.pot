"``CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES`` is a boolean specifying whether CMake will scan C++ "
"sources in the target for module dependencies.  See also the :prop_sf:"
"`CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES` for per-source settings which, if set, overrides the "
"target-wide settings."

"This property is initialized by the value of the :variable:"
"`CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES` variable if it is set when a target is created."

"When this property is set ``ON`` or unset, CMake will scan the target's "
"``CXX`` sources at build time and add module dependency information to the "
"compile line as necessary.  When this property is set ``OFF``, CMake will "
"not scan the target's ``CXX`` sources at build time."

"Note that scanning is only performed if C++20 or higher is enabled for the "
"target.  Scanning for modules in the target's sources belonging to file sets "
"of type ``CXX_MODULES`` is always performed."
