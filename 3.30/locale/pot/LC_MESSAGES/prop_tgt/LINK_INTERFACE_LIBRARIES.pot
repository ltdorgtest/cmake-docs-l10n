"By default linking to a shared library target transitively links to targets "
"with which the library itself was linked.  For an executable with exports "
"(see the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property) no default transitive "
"link dependencies are used.  This property replaces the default transitive "
"link dependencies with an explicit list.  When the target is linked into "
"another target using the :command:`target_link_libraries` command, the "
"libraries listed (and recursively their link interface libraries) will be "
"provided to the other target also.  If the list is empty then no transitive "
"link dependencies will be incorporated when this target is linked into "
"another target even if the default set is non-empty.  This property is "
"initialized by the value of the :variable:`CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES` "
"variable if it is set when a target is created.  This property is ignored "
"for ``STATIC`` libraries."
