"This is a CMake :ref:`Environment Variable <CMake Language Environment "

"The ``CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE`` environment variable allows users to operate "
"CMake in an alternate mode of :command:`file(INSTALL)` and :command:"
"`install()`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../envvar/CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE.rst:11
msgid ""
"The default behavior for an installation is to copy a source file from a "
"source directory into a destination directory. This environment variable "
"however allows the user to override this behavior, causing CMake to create "
"symbolic links instead."

msgid "Usage Scenarios"

#: ../../../envvar/CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE.rst:19
msgid ""
"Installing symbolic links rather than copying files can help in the "

msgid ""
"Conserving storage space because files do not have to be duplicated on disk."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../envvar/CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE.rst:23
msgid ""
"Changes to the source of the symbolic link are seen at the install "
"destination without having to re-run the install step."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../envvar/CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE.rst:25
msgid ""
"Editing through the link at the install destination will modify the source "
"of the link. This may be useful when dealing with CMake project hierarchies, "
"i.e. using :module:`ExternalProject` and consistent source navigation and "
"refactoring is desired across projects."

"For the environment variable to take effect, it must be set during the "
"correct build phase(s)."

#: ../../../envvar/CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE.rst:74
msgid ""
"If the project calls :command:`file(INSTALL)` directly, the environment "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../envvar/CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE.rst:76
msgid ""
"In order to apply to :command:`install()`, the environment variable must be "
"set during installation.  This could be during a build if using the "
"``install`` or ``package`` build targets, or separate from the build when "
"invoking an install or running :manual:`cpack <cpack(1)>` from the command "
"line."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../envvar/CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE.rst:81
msgid ""
"When using :module:`ExternalProject`, it might be required during the build "

"will execute during the main project's build phase."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../envvar/CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE.rst:85
msgid ""
"Given the above, it is recommended to set the environment variable "

msgid ""
"Use this environment variable with caution. The following highlights some "

#: ../../../envvar/CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE.rst:96

msgstr ""

#: ../../../envvar/CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE.rst:98

"`ExternalProject` is more complex. For further details, see that module's "
"documentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../envvar/CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE.rst:102
msgid ""
"A symbolic link ties the destination to the source in a persistent way. "
"Writing to either of the two affects both file system objects. This is in "
"contrast to normal install behavior which only copies files as they were at "
"the time the install was performed, with no enduring relationship between "
"the source and destination of the install."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../envvar/CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE.rst:108
msgid ""
"Combining ``CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE`` with :prop_tgt:`IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED` is "
"not supported."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../envvar/CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE.rst:111
msgid ""
"Changing ``CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE`` from what it was on a previous run can lead "
"to unexpected results.  Moving from a non-symlinking mode to a symlinking "
"mode will discard any previous file at the destination, but the reverse is "
"not true.  Once a symlink exists at the destination, even if you switch to a "
"non-symlink mode, the symlink will continue to exist at the destination and "
"will not be replaced by an actual file."
