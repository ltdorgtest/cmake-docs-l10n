"A :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` specifying runtime "
"path (``RPATH``) entries to add to binaries linked in the build tree (for "
"platforms that support it).  By default, CMake sets the runtime path of "
"binaries in the build tree to contain search paths it knows are needed to "
"find the shared libraries they link. Projects may set ``BUILD_RPATH`` to "
"specify additional search paths."

"The build-tree runtime path will *not* be used for binaries in the install "
