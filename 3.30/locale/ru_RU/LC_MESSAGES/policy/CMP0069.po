"CMake 3.9 and newer prefer to add IPO flags whenever the :prop_tgt:"
"`INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION` target property is enabled and produce an "
"error if flags are not known to CMake for the current compiler. Since a "
"given compiler may not support IPO flags in all environments in which it is "
"used, it is now the project's responsibility to use the :module:"
"`CheckIPOSupported` module to check for support before enabling the :"
"prop_tgt:`INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION` target property.  This approach "
"allows a project to conditionally activate IPO when supported.  It also "
"allows an end user to set the :variable:`CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION` "
"variable in an environment known to support IPO even if the project does not "
"enable the property."
