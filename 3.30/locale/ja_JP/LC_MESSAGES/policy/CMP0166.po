":genex:`TARGET_PROPERTY` evaluates link properties transitively over private "

"In CMake 3.29 and below, the :genex:`TARGET_PROPERTY` generator expression "
"evaluates properties :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_OPTIONS`, :prop_tgt:"
"`INTERFACE_LINK_DIRECTORIES`, and :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_DEPENDS` as if "
"they were :ref:`Transitive Compile Properties` rather than :ref:`Transitive "
"Link Properties`, even when policy :policy:`CMP0099` is set to ``NEW``.  "
"Private dependencies of static libraries, which appear in their :prop_tgt:"
"`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` guarded by :genex:`LINK_ONLY` generator "
"expressions, are not followed.  This is inconsistent with evaluation of the "
"same target properties during buildsystem generation."

"CMake 3.30 and above prefer that :genex:`TARGET_PROPERTY` evaluates "
"properties :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_OPTIONS`, :prop_tgt:"
"`INTERFACE_LINK_DIRECTORIES`, and :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_DEPENDS` as :ref:"
"`Transitive Link Properties` such that private dependencies of static "
"libraries, which appear in their :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` "
"guarded by :genex:`LINK_ONLY` generator expressions, are followed. This "
"policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated to "
"expect the new behavior."

"they were :ref:`Transitive Compile Properties` by not following private "
"dependencies of static libraries.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is "
"to evaluate them as :ref:`Transitive Link Properties` by following private "
