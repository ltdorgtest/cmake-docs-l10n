"Specify the minimum version of the target platform (e.g. macOS or iOS) on "
"which the target binaries are to be deployed.  CMake uses this variable "
"value for the ``-mmacosx-version-min`` flag or their respective target "
"platform equivalents.  For older Xcode versions that shipped multiple macOS "
"SDKs this variable also helps to choose the SDK in case :variable:"

"The value of this variable should be set prior to the first :command:"
"`project` or :command:`enable_language` command invocation because it may "
"influence configuration of the toolchain and flags. It is intended to be set "
"locally by the user creating a build tree. This variable should be set as a "
"``CACHE`` entry (or else CMake may remove it while initializing a cache "
"entry of the same name) unless policy :policy:`CMP0126` is set to ``NEW``."
