":ref:`Semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of CMake language "
"files to include as part of the very first :command:`project` call. The "
"files will be included immediately after the toolchain file has been read "
"(if one is specified) and platform variables have been set, but before any "
"languages have been enabled. Therefore, language-specific variables, "
"including things like :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER`, might not be set. "
"See :ref:`Code Injection` for a more detailed discussion of files "
"potentially included during a :command:`project` call."

"This variable is intended for specifying files that perform one-time setup "
"for the build. It provides an injection point for things like configuring "
"package managers, adding logic the user shares between projects (e.g. "
"defining their own custom build types), and so on. It is primarily for users "
"to add things specific to their environment, but not for specifying the "
"toolchain details (use :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` for that)."
