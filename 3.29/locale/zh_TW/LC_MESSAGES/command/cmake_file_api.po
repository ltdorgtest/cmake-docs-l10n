"Each of the optional keywords ``CODEMODEL``, ``CACHE``, ``CMAKEFILES`` and "
"``TOOLCHAINS`` correspond to one of the object kinds that can be requested "
"by the project.  The ``configureLog`` object kind cannot be set with this "
"command, since it must be set before CMake starts reading the top level "
"``CMakeLists.txt`` file."

"For each of the optional keywords, the ``<versions>`` list must contain one "
"or more version values of the form ``major`` or ``major.minor``, where "
"``major`` and ``minor`` are integers.  Projects should list the versions "
"they accept in their preferred order, as only the first supported value from "
"the list will be selected.  The command will ignore versions with a "
"``major`` version higher than any major version it supports for that object "
"kind. It will raise an error if it encounters an invalid version number, or "
"if none of the requested versions is supported."

"It is not an error to add a query for the same thing more than once, whether "

"A project may want to use replies from the file API at build time to "
"implement some form of verification task.  Instead of relying on something "
"outside of CMake to create a query file, the project can use "
"``cmake_file_api(QUERY)`` to request the required information for the "
"current run.  It can then create a custom command to run at build time, "
"knowing that the requested information should always be available."
