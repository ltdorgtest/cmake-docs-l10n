"CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed a signature for :command:`add_custom_command` "
"which specified an input to a command.  This was undocumented behavior. "
"Modern use of CMake associates custom commands with their output, rather "
"than their input."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow the use of :command:"
