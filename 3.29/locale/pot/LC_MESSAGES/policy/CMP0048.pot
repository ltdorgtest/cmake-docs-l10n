"CMake version 3.0 introduced the ``VERSION`` option of the :command:"
"`project` command to specify a project version as well as the name.  In "
"order to keep :variable:`PROJECT_VERSION` and related variables consistent "
"with variable :variable:`PROJECT_NAME` it is necessary to set the "
"``VERSION`` variables to the empty string when no ``VERSION`` is given to :"
"command:`project`. However, this can change behavior for existing projects "
"that set ``VERSION`` variables themselves since :command:`project` may now "
"clear them. This policy controls the behavior for compatibility with such "
"projects."
