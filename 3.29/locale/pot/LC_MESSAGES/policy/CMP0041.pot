"Diagnostics in CMake 2.8.12 and lower silently ignored an entry in the :"

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore relative path entries if "
"they contain a generator expression. The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is "
"to report an error if a generator expression appears in another location and "
"the path is relative."

"and uses ``OLD`` behavior."
