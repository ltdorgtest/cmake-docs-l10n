"The logical name of executable and library targets does not have to "
"correspond to the physical file names built.  Consider using the :prop_tgt:"
"`OUTPUT_NAME` target property to create two targets with the same physical "
"name while keeping logical names distinct.  Custom targets must simply have "
"globally unique names (unless one uses the global property :prop_gbl:"
"`ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS` with a Makefiles generator)."
