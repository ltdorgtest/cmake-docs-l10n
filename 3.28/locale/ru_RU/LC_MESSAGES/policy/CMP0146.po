"The :module:`FindCUDA` module has been deprecated since CMake 3.10. CMake "
"3.27 and above prefer to not provide the module. This policy provides "
"compatibility for projects that have not been ported away from it."

"Projects using the :module:`FindCUDA` module should be updated to use "
"CMake's first-class ``CUDA`` language support.  List ``CUDA`` among the "
"languages named in the top-level call to the :command:`project` command, or "
"call the :command:`enable_language` command with ``CUDA``. Then one can add "
"CUDA (``.cu``) sources directly to targets, similar to other languages."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for ``find_package(CUDA)`` to load "
"the deprecated module.  The ``NEW`` behavior is for uses of the module to "
"fail as if it does not exist."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.27.  CMake version |release| "
"warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior. Use the :command:"
"`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-"
