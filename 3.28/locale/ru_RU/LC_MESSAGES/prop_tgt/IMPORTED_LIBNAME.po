"An interface library builds no library file itself but does specify usage "
"requirements for its consumers.  The ``IMPORTED_LIBNAME`` property may be "
"set to specify a single library name to be placed on the link line in place "
"of the interface library target name as a requirement for using the "
"interface."

"This property is intended for use in naming libraries provided by a platform "
"SDK for which the full path to a library file may not be known.  The value "
"may be a plain library name such as ``foo`` but may *not* be a path (e.g. ``/"
"usr/lib/libfoo.so``) or a flag (e.g. ``-Wl,...``).  The name is never "
"treated as a library target name even if it happens to name one."

"The ``IMPORTED_LIBNAME`` property is allowed only on :ref:`imported "
"<Imported Targets>` :ref:`Interface Libraries` and is rejected on targets of "
"other types (for which the :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION` target property may "
"be used)."
