"If set, this will tell the required compilers to enable device linking on "
"the library target. Device linking is an additional link step required by "
"some CUDA compilers when :prop_tgt:`CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION` is enabled. "
"Normally device linking is deferred until a shared library or executable is "
"generated, allowing for multiple static libraries to resolve device symbols "
"at the same time when they are used by a shared library or executable."
