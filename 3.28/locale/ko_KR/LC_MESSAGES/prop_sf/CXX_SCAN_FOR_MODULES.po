"``CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES`` is a boolean specifying whether CMake will scan the "
"source for C++ module dependencies.  See also the :prop_tgt:"

"When this property is set ``ON``, CMake will scan the source at build time "
"and add module dependency information to the compile line as necessary.  "
"When this property is set ``OFF``, CMake will not scan the source at build "
"time.  When this property is unset, the :prop_tgt:`CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES` "
"property is consulted."

"Note that scanning is only performed if C++20 or higher is enabled for the "
"target and the source uses the ``CXX`` language.  Scanning for modules in "
"sources belonging to file sets of type ``CXX_MODULES`` is always performed."
