"The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2017 and above allow to select "
"minor versions of the same toolset. The toolset version number may be "
"specified by a field in :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET` of the form "
"``version=14.11``. If none is specified CMake will choose a default toolset. "
"The value may be empty if no minor version was selected and the default is "
"used."

"VS 16.9's toolset may also be specified as ``14.28.16.9`` because VS 16.10 "

"The ``version=`` field may be given a three-component toolset version such "
"as ``14.28.29910``, and CMake will convert it to the name used by MSBuild "
"``Microsoft.VCToolsVersion.*.props`` files.  This is useful to distinguish "
"between VS 16.8's ``14.28.29333`` toolset and VS 16.9's ``14.28.29910`` "
"toolset.  It also matches ``vcvarsall``'s ``-vcvars_ver=`` behavior."
