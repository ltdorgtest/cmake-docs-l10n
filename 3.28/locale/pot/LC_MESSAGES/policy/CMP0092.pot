"MSVC warning flags are not in :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` by default."

msgid ""
"When using MSVC-like compilers in CMake 3.14 and below, warning flags like "
"``/W3`` are added to :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` by default. This is "
"problematic for projects that want to choose a different warning level "
"programmatically.  In particular, it requires string editing of the :"
"variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` variables with knowledge of the CMake builtin "
"defaults so they can be replaced."

"CMake 3.15 and above prefer to leave out warning flags from the value of :"
"variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` by default."

"This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated "
"to expect the lack of warning flags.  The policy setting takes effect as of "
"the first :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language` command that "
"initializes :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` for a given language ``<LANG>``."

"Once the policy has taken effect at the top of a project for a given "
"language, that choice must be used throughout the tree for that language. In "
"projects that have nested projects in subdirectories, be sure to convert "
"everything together."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to place MSVC warning flags in the "
"default :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` cache entries.  The ``NEW`` behavior "
"for this policy is to *not* place MSVC warning flags in the default cache "
"entries."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.15.  Use the :command:"
"`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly. Unlike "
"many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn when this policy is "
"not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior."

msgid ""
"The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-"
