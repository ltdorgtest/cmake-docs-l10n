"Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic and -Bdynamic to determine "
"whether to use static or shared libraries for -lXXX options. CMake uses "
"these options to set the link type for libraries whose full paths are not "
"known or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for the platform.  "
"By default CMake adds an option at the end of the library list (if "
"necessary) to set the linker search type back to its starting type.  This "
"property switches the final linker search type to -Bstatic regardless of how "
"it started."
