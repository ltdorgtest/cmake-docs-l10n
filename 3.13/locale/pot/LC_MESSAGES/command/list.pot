"The list subcommands ``APPEND``, ``INSERT``, ``FILTER``, ``REMOVE_AT``, "
"``REMOVE_ITEM``, ``REMOVE_DUPLICATES``, ``REVERSE`` and ``SORT`` may create "
"new values for the list within the current CMake variable scope.  Similar to "
"the :command:`set` command, the LIST command creates new variable values in "
"the current scope, even if the list itself is actually defined in a parent "
"scope.  To propagate the results of these operations upwards, use :command:"
"`set` with ``PARENT_SCOPE``, :command:`set` with ``CACHE INTERNAL``, or some "
"other means of value propagation."

"A list in cmake is a ``;`` separated group of strings.  To create a list the "
"set command can be used.  For example, ``set(var a b c d e)`` creates a list "
"with ``a;b;c;d;e``, and ``set(var \"a b c d e\")`` creates a string or a "
"list with one item in it.   (Note macro arguments are not variables, and "
"therefore cannot be used in LIST commands.)"

"When specifying index values, if ``<element index>`` is 0 or greater, it is "
"indexed from the beginning of the list, with 0 representing the first list "
"element.  If ``<element index>`` is -1 or lesser, it is indexed from the end "
"of the list, with -1 representing the last list element. Be careful when "
"counting with negative indices: they do not start from 0.  -0 is equivalent "
"to 0, the first list element."
