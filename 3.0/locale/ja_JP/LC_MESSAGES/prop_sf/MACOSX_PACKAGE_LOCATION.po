"FRAMEWORK property set are built as Mac OS X frameworks on Apple platforms.  "
"Module library targets with the BUNDLE property set are built as Mac OS X "
"CFBundle bundles on Apple platforms.  Source files listed in the target with "
"this property set will be copied to a directory inside the bundle or "
"framework content folder specified by the property value.  For bundles the "
"content folder is \"<name>.app/Contents\".  For frameworks the content "
"folder is \"<name>.framework/Versions/<version>\".  For cfbundles the "
"content folder is \"<name>.bundle/Contents\" (unless the extension is "
"changed). See the PUBLIC_HEADER, PRIVATE_HEADER, and RESOURCE target "
"properties for specifying files meant for Headers, PrivateHeaders, or "
"Resources directories."
