"AUTOMOC is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle the Qt ``moc`` "
"preprocessor automatically, i.e.  without having to use the :module:"
"`QT4_WRAP_CPP() <FindQt4>` or QT5_WRAP_CPP() macro.  Currently Qt4 and Qt5 "
"are supported.  When this property is set ``ON``, CMake will scan the source "
"files at build time and invoke moc accordingly.  If an ``#include`` "
"statement like ``#include \"moc_foo.cpp\"`` is found, the ``Q_OBJECT`` class "
"declaration is expected in the header, and ``moc`` is run on the header "
"file.  If an ``#include`` statement like ``#include \"foo.moc\"`` is found, "
"then a ``Q_OBJECT`` is expected in the current source file and ``moc`` is "
"run on the file itself.  Additionally, header files with the same base name "
"(like ``foo.h``) or ``_p`` appended to the base name (like ``foo_p.h``) are "
"parsed for ``Q_OBJECT`` macros, and if found, ``moc`` is also executed on "
"those files. ``AUTOMOC`` checks multiple header alternative extensions, such "
"as ``hpp``, ``hxx`` etc when searching for headers. The resulting moc files, "
"which are not included as shown above in any of the source files are "
"included in a generated ``<targetname>_automoc.cpp`` file, which is compiled "
"as part of the target.  This property is initialized by the value of the :"
"variable:`CMAKE_AUTOMOC` variable if it is set when a target is created."
