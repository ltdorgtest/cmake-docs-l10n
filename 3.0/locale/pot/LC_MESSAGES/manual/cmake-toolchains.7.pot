"CMake uses a toolchain of utilities to compile, link libraries and create "
"archives, and other tasks to drive the build. The toolchain utilities "
"available are determined by the languages enabled. In normal builds, CMake "
"automatically determines the toolchain for host builds based on system "
"introspection and defaults. In cross-compiling scenarios, a toolchain file "
"may be specified with information about compiler and utility paths."

"Several variables relate to the language components of a toolchain which are "

"used for ``<LANG>``. :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` is the identifier "
"used by CMake for the compiler and :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION` "
"is the version of the compiler."

"As the linker is invoked by the compiler driver, CMake needs a way to "
"determine which compiler to use to invoke the linker. This is calculated by "
"the :prop_sf:`LANGUAGE` of source files in the target, and in the case of "
"static libraries, the language of the dependent libraries. The choice CMake "
"makes may be overridden with the :prop_tgt:`LINKER_LANGUAGE` target property."

"CMake provides the :command:`try_compile` command and wrapper macros such "
"as :module:`CheckCXXSourceCompiles`, :module:`CheckCXXSymbolExists` and :"
"module:`CheckIncludeFile` to test capability and availability of various "
"toolchain features. These APIs test the toolchain in some way and cache the "
"result so that the test does not have to be performed again the next time "
"CMake runs."

"Some toolchain features have built-in handling in CMake, and do not require "
"compile-tests. For example, :prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` allows "
"specifying that a target should be built as position-independent code, if "
"the compiler supports that feature. The :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET` "
"and :prop_tgt:`VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN` target properties add flags for "
"hidden visibility, if supported by the compiler."
