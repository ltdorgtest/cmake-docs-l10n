"Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a project have globally "
"unique logical names (see policy CMP0002).  This is necessary to generate "
"meaningful project file names in Xcode and VS IDE generators.  It also "
"allows the target names to be referenced unambiguously."

"Makefile generators are capable of supporting duplicate custom target "
"names.  For projects that care only about Makefile generators and do not "
"wish to support Xcode or VS IDE generators, one may set this property to "
"true to allow duplicate custom targets.  The property allows multiple "
"add_custom_target command calls in different directories to specify the same "
"target name.  However, setting this property will cause non-Makefile "
"generators to produce an error and refuse to generate the project."
