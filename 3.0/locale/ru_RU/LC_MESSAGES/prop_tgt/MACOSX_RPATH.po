"When this property is set to true, the directory portion of the "
"\"install_name\" field of shared libraries will be ``@rpath`` unless "
"overridden by :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_NAME_DIR`.  Runtime paths will also be "
"embedded in binaries using this target and can be controlled by the :"
"prop_tgt:`INSTALL_RPATH` target property. This property is initialized by "
"the value of the variable :variable:`CMAKE_MACOSX_RPATH` if it is set when a "
"target is created."

"alternative to ``@executable_path`` and ``@loader_path``."
