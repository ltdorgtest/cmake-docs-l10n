"The list subcommands APPEND, INSERT, REMOVE_AT, REMOVE_ITEM, "
"REMOVE_DUPLICATES, REVERSE and SORT may create new values for the list "
"within the current CMake variable scope.  Similar to the SET command, the "
"LIST command creates new variable values in the current scope, even if the "
"list itself is actually defined in a parent scope.  To propagate the results "
"of these operations upwards, use SET with PARENT_SCOPE, SET with CACHE "
"INTERNAL, or some other means of value propagation."

"NOTES: A list in cmake is a ; separated group of strings.  To create a list "
"the set command can be used.  For example, set(var a b c d e) creates a list "
"with a;b;c;d;e, and set(var \"a b c d e\") creates a string or a list with "
"one item in it.   (Note macro arguments are not variables, and therefore "
"cannot be used in LIST commands.)"

"When specifying index values, if <element index> is 0 or greater, it is "
"indexed from the beginning of the list, with 0 representing the first list "
"element.  If <element index> is -1 or lesser, it is indexed from the end of "
"the list, with -1 representing the last list element. Be careful when "
"counting with negative indices: they do not start from 0.  -0 is equivalent "
"to 0, the first list element."
