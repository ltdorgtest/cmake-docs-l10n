"Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX() commands.  It contains "
"the \"base\" directories, the FIND_XXX() commands append appropriate "
"subdirectories to the base directories.  So FIND_PROGRAM() adds /bin to each "
"of the directories in the path, FIND_LIBRARY() appends /lib to each of the "
"directories, and FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append /include .  By default "
"it is empty, it is intended to be set by the project.  See also "
"CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH, "
