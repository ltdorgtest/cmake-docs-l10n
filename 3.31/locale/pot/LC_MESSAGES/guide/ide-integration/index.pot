"Many IDE vendors will want to bundle a copy of CMake with their IDE. IDEs "
"that bundle CMake should present the user with the option of using an "
"external CMake installation instead of the bundled one, in case the bundled "
"copy becomes outdated and the user wants to use a newer version."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../guide/ide-integration/index.rst:23
msgid ""
"While IDE vendors may be tempted to bundle different versions of CMake with "
"their application, such practice is not recommended. CMake has strong "
"guarantees of backwards compatibility, and there is no reason not to use a "
"newer version of CMake than what a project requires, or indeed, the very "
"latest version. Therefore, it is recommended that IDE vendors that bundle "
"CMake with their application always include the very latest patch version of "
"CMake available at the time of release."

"As a suggestion, IDEs may also ship a copy of the Ninja buildsystem "
"alongside CMake. Ninja is highly performant and well-supported on all "
"platforms that support CMake. IDEs that bundle Ninja should use Ninja 1.10 "
"or later, which contains features needed to support Fortran builds."

"CMake supports a file format called ``CMakePresets.json``, and its user-"
"specific counterpart, ``CMakeUserPresets.json``. This file contains "
"information on the various configure presets that a user may want. Each "
"preset may have a different compiler, build flags, etc. The details of this "
"format are explained in the :manual:`cmake(1)` manual."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../guide/ide-integration/index.rst:45
msgid ""
"IDE vendors are encouraged to read and evaluate this file the same way CMake "
"does, and present the user with the presets listed in the file. Users should "
"be able to see (and possibly edit) the CMake cache variables, environment "
"variables, and command line options that are defined for a given preset. The "
"IDE should then construct the list of appropriate :manual:`cmake(1)` command "
"line arguments based on these settings, rather than using the :option:`--"
"preset= <cmake --preset>` option directly. The :option:`--preset= <cmake --"
"preset>` option is intended only as a convenient frontend for command line "
"users, and should not be used by the IDE."

"In cases where a preset contains lots of cache variables, and passing all of "
"them as :option:`-D <cmake -D>` flags would cause the command line length "
"limit of the platform to be exceeded, the IDE should instead construct a "
"temporary cache script and pass it with the :option:`-C <cmake -C>` flag."

"While reading, parsing, and evaluating the contents of ``CMakePresets.json`` "
"is straightforward, it is not trivial. In addition to the documentation, IDE "
"vendors may also wish to refer to the CMake source code and test cases for a "
"better understanding of how to implement the format. :download:`This file "
"<../../manual/presets/schema.json>` provides a machine-readable JSON schema "
"for the ``CMakePresets.json`` format that IDE vendors may find useful for "
"validation and providing editing assistance."

"<cmake-file-api(7)>`. The manual page for the File API contains more "

"IDEs should avoid creating more build trees than necessary, and only create "

"multiple single-config build trees which all have the same properties except "
"for a differing :variable:`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`, effectively creating a multi-"
"config environment. Instead, the :generator:`Ninja Multi-Config` generator, "
