"When linking to a ``STATIC`` library target with cyclic dependencies the "
"linker may need to scan more than once through the archives in the strongly "
"connected component of the dependency graph.  CMake by default constructs "
"the link line so that the linker will scan through the component at least "
"twice.  This property specifies the minimum number of scans if it is larger "
"than the default.  CMake uses the largest value specified by any target in a "
"component."
