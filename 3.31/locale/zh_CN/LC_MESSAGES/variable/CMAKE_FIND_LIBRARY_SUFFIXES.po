"This specifies what suffixes to add to library names when the :command:"
"`find_library` command looks for libraries.  On Windows systems this is "
"typically ``.lib`` and, depending on the compiler, ``.dll.lib``, ``.dll.a``, "
"``.a`` (e.g. rustc, GCC, or Clang), so when it tries to find the ``foo`` "
"library, it will look for ``[<prefix>]foo[.dll].lib`` and/or "
"``[<prefix>]foo[.dll].a``, depending on the compiler used and the "
"``<prefix>`` specified in the :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES`."
