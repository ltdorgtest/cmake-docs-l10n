"In CMake 3.13 and lower, the ``$<IN_LIST:...>`` generator expression always "
"returned ``0`` if the first argument was empty, even if the list contained "
"an empty item. This behavior is inconsistent with the ``IN_LIST`` behavior "
"of :command:`if`, which this generator expression is meant to emulate. CMake "
"3.14 and later handles this case correctly."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for ``$<IN_LIST:...>`` to always "
"return ``0`` if the first argument is empty. The ``NEW`` behavior is to "

"item."
