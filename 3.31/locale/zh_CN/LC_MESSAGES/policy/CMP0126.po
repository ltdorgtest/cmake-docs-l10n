"When this policy is set to ``NEW``, the :command:`set(CACHE)` command does "
"not remove any normal variable of the same name from the current scope. The "
"``OLD`` behavior removes any normal variable of the same name from the "
"current scope in the following situations:"

"A cache variable of that name existed previously, but it had no type. This "
"can occur when the variable was set on the command line using a form like "
"``cmake -DMYVAR=blah`` instead of ``cmake -DMYVAR:STRING=blah``."

"Note that the ``NEW`` behavior has an important difference to the similar "
"``NEW`` behavior of policy :policy:`CMP0077`.  The :command:`set(CACHE)` "
"command always sets the cache variable if it did not exist previously, "
"regardless of the ``CMP0126`` policy setting.  The :command:`option` command "
"will *not* set the cache variable if a non-cache variable of the same name "
"already exists and :policy:`CMP0077` is set to ``NEW``."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. "
"It may be set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:"
"`cmake_minimum_required`. If it is not set, CMake |WARNS_OR_DOES_NOT_WARN|, "
"and uses ``OLD`` behavior."
