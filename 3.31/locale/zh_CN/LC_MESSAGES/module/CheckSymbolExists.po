"If the header files define the symbol as a macro it is considered available "

"intrinsics may not be detected). If the symbol is a type, enum value, or "
"intrinsic it will not be recognized (consider using :module:`CheckTypeSize` "
"or :module:`CheckSourceCompiles`). If the check needs to be done in C++, "
