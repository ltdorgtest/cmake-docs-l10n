"A read-only property that indicates where a target's main file is located on "
"disk for the configuration ``<CONFIG>``.  The property is defined only for "
"library and executable targets.  An imported target may provide a set of "
"configurations different from that of the importing project.  By default "
"CMake looks for an exact-match but otherwise uses an arbitrary available "
"configuration.  Use the :prop_tgt:`MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>` property to "
"map imported configurations explicitly."

"Do not set properties that affect the location of a target after reading "
"this property.  These include properties whose names match ``(RUNTIME|"
"LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_<CONFIG>)?``, ``(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|"
"SUFFIX)``, or  :prop_tgt:`LINKER_LANGUAGE`. Failure to follow this rule is "
"not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target undefined."
