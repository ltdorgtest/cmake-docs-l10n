"On platforms that support runtime paths (``RPATH``) with the ``$ORIGIN`` "
"token, setting this property to ``TRUE`` enables relative paths in the build "
"``RPATH`` for executables and shared libraries that point to shared "
"libraries in the same build tree."

msgid ""
"Normally the build ``RPATH`` of a binary contains absolute paths to the "
"directory of each shared library it links to.  The ``RPATH`` entries for "
"directories contained within the build tree can be made relative to enable "
"relocatable builds and to help achieve reproducible builds by omitting the "
"build directory from the build environment."

"This property has no effect on platforms that do not support the ``$ORIGIN`` "
"token in ``RPATH``, or when the :variable:`CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH` variable is "
"set. The runtime path set through the :prop_tgt:`BUILD_RPATH` target "
"property is also unaffected by this property."
