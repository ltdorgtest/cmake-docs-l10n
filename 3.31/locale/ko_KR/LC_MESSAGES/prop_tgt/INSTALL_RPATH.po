"By default, the install rpath is empty. It can be set using this property, "
"which is a semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed "
"targets (for platforms that support it).  This property is initialized by "
"the value of the variable :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH` if it is set when "
"a target is created. Beside setting the install rpath manually, using the :"
"prop_tgt:`INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH` target property it can also be "
"generated automatically by CMake."

msgid ""
"Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building executables "
"etc on systems that use RPATH, see the :prop_tgt:`BUILD_RPATH` target "
"property. When the software is installed the targets are edited (or "
"relinked) by CMake (see :variable:`CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH`) to have the "
"install RPATH. This editing during installation can be avoided via the :"
"prop_tgt:`BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH` target property."

"For handling toolchain-dependent RPATH entries the :prop_tgt:"
"`INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH` can be used. Runtime paths can be "
"disabled completely via the :variable:`CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH` variable."

"Because the rpath may contain ``${ORIGIN}``, which coincides with CMake "
"syntax, the contents of ``INSTALL_RPATH`` are properly escaped in the "
"``cmake_install.cmake`` script (see policy :policy:`CMP0095`.)"
