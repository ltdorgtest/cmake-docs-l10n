"Starting with CMake 2.8.4, if a cmake-module shipped with CMake (i.e. "
"located in the CMake module directory) calls :command:`include` or :command:"
"`find_package`, the files located in the CMake module directory are "
"preferred over the files in :variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`.  This makes sure "
"that the modules belonging to CMake always get those files included which "
"they expect, and against which they were developed and tested.  In all other "
"cases, the files found in :variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` still take "
"precedence over the ones in the CMake module directory.  The ``OLD`` "
"behavior is to always prefer files from CMAKE_MODULE_PATH over files from "
"the CMake modules directory."

"It may be set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:"

"and uses ``OLD`` behavior."
