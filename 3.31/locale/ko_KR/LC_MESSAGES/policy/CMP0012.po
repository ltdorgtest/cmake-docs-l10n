"In CMake versions 2.6.4 and lower the :command:`if` command implicitly "
"dereferenced arguments corresponding to variables, even those named like "
"numbers or boolean constants, except for ``0`` and ``1``.  Numbers and "
"boolean constants such as ``true``, ``false``, ``yes``, ``no``, ``on``, "
"``off``, ``y``, ``n``, ``notfound``, ``ignore`` (all case insensitive) were "
"recognized in some cases but not all.  For example, the code ``if(TRUE)`` "
"might have evaluated as ``false``. Numbers such as 2 were recognized only in "
"boolean expressions like ``if(NOT 2)`` (leading to ``false``) but not as a "
"single-argument like ``if(2)`` (also leading to ``false``).  Later versions "
"of CMake prefer to treat numbers and boolean constants literally, so they "
"should not be used as variable names."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to implicitly dereference variables "
"named like numbers and boolean constants.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this "
"policy is to recognize numbers and boolean constants without dereferencing "
"variables with such names."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. "
"It may be set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:"
"`cmake_minimum_required`. If it is not set, CMake |WARNS_OR_DOES_NOT_WARN|, "
"and uses ``OLD`` behavior."
