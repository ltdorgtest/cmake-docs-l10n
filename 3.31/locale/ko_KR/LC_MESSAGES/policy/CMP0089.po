"CMake 3.15 and above recognize that IBM's Clang-based XL compilers that "
"define ``__ibmxl__`` are a new front-end distinct from ``xlc`` with a "
"different command line and set of capabilities. CMake now prefers to present "
"this to projects by setting the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` "
"variable to ``XLClang`` instead of ``XL``.  However, existing projects may "
"assume the compiler id for Clang-based XL is just ``XL`` as it was in CMake "
"versions prior to 3.15. Therefore this policy determines for Clang-based XL "
"compilers which compiler id to report in the :variable:"
"`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable after language ``<LANG>`` is enabled by "
"the :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language` command.  The policy "
"must be set prior to the invocation of either command."

"and uses ``OLD`` behavior."
