"CMake 3.29 and below provide a ``FindBoost`` module, but it needs constant "
"updates to keep up with upstream Boost releases.  Upstream Boost 1.70 and "
"above provide a ``BoostConfig.cmake`` package configuration file. "
"``find_package(Boost CONFIG)`` finds the upstream package directly, without "
"the find module."

"CMake 3.30 and above prefer to not provide the ``FindBoost`` module so that "
"``find_package(Boost)`` calls, without the ``CONFIG`` or ``NO_MODULE`` "
"options, find the upstream ``BoostConfig.cmake`` directly. This policy "
"provides compatibility for projects that have not been ported to use the "
"upstream Boost package."
