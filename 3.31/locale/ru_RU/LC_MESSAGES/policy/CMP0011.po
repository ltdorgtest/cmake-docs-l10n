"In CMake 2.6.2 and below, CMake Policy settings in scripts loaded by the :"
"command:`include` and :command:`find_package` commands would affect the "
"includer.  Explicit invocations of ``cmake_policy(PUSH)`` and "
"``cmake_policy(POP)`` were required to isolate policy changes and protect "
"the includer.  While some scripts intend to affect the policies of their "
"includer, most do not.  In CMake 2.6.3 and above, :command:`include` and :"
"command:`find_package` by default ``PUSH`` and ``POP`` an entry on the "
"policy stack around an included script, but provide a ``NO_POLICY_SCOPE`` "
"option to disable it.  This policy determines whether or not to imply "
"``NO_POLICY_SCOPE`` for compatibility.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy "
"is to imply ``NO_POLICY_SCOPE`` for :command:`include` and :command:"
"`find_package` commands. The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to allow "
"the commands to do their default cmake_policy ``PUSH`` and ``POP``."

"and uses ``OLD`` behavior."
