"Well-behaved CMake-based buildsystems do not create any output in the source "

"suitable buildsystem, then the user invokes a build tool to process that "
"generated buildsystem.  The generated buildsystem is specific to the machine "
"used to generate it and is not redistributable.  Each consumer of a provided "
