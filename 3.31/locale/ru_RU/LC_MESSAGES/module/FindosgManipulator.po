"This is part of the ``Findosg*`` suite used to find OpenSceneGraph "

"You must also opt into OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer if needed) as "
"these modules won't do it for you.  This is to allow you control over your "
"own system piece by piece in case you need to opt out of certain components "
"or change the Find behavior for a particular module (perhaps because the "
"default :module:`FindOpenGL` module doesn't work with your system as an "
"example).  If you want to use a more convenient module that includes "
"everything, use the :module:`FindOpenSceneGraph` instead of the ``Findosg*."
