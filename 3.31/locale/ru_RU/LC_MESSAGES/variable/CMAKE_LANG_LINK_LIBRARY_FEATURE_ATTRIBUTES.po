"This variable defines the semantics of the specified link library "
"``<FEATURE>`` when linking with the link language ``<LANG>``. It takes "
"precedence over :variable:`CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_<FEATURE>_ATTRIBUTES` if that "
"variable is also defined for the same ``<FEATURE>``, but otherwise has "
"similar effects. See :variable:`CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_<FEATURE>_ATTRIBUTES` for "
"further details."
