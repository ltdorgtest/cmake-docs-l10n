"If this is set to ``TRUE``, then the rpath information is not added to "
"compiled executables.  The default is to add rpath information if the "
"platform supports it.  This allows for easy running from the build tree.  To "
"omit RPATH in the install step, but not the build step, use :variable:"
"`CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH` instead. To omit RPATH in the build step, use :"
