"This variable is an alternative to providing the ``--log-context`` option on "
"the :manual:`cmake <cmake(1)>` command line.  Whereas the command line "
"option will apply only to that one CMake run, setting "
"``CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT_SHOW`` to true as a cache variable will ensure that "
"subsequent CMake runs will continue to show the message context."

"Projects should not set ``CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT_SHOW``.  It is intended for "
"users so that they may control whether or not to include context with "
"messages."
