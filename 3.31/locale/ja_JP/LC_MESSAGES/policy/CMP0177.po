msgid ""
"The :command:`install` command has a number of different forms, and most of "
"them take a ``DESTINATION`` keyword, some in more than one place. CMake 3.30 "
"and earlier used the value given after the ``DESTINATION`` keyword as "
"provided with no transformations.  The :command:`install(EXPORT)` form "
"assumes the path contains no ``..`` or ``.`` path components when computing "
"a path relative to the ``DESTINATION``, and if the project provided a path "
"that violated that assumption, the computed path would be incorrect."

"CMake 3.31 normalizes all ``DESTINATION`` values given in any form of the :"
"command:`install` command, except for the ``INCLUDES DESTINATION`` of the :"
"command:`install(TARGETS)` form.  The normalization performed is the same as "
"for the :command:`cmake_path` command (see :ref:`Normalization`)."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy performs no translation on the "
"``DESTINATION`` values of any :command:`install` command.  They are used "
"exactly as provided.  If a destination path contains ``..`` or ``.`` path "
"components, :command:`install(EXPORT)` will use the same wrong paths as "
"CMake 3.30 and earlier."

"The ``NEW`` behavior will normalize all ``DESTINATION`` values except for "
"``INCLUDES DESTINATION``.  If a destination path contains a generator "
"expression, it will be wrapped in a ``$<PATH:CMAKE_PATH,NORMALIZE,...>`` "
"generator expression."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.31. It may be set by :command:"
"`cmake_policy` or :command:`cmake_minimum_required`. If it is not set, CMake "
"will warn if it detects a path that would be different if normalized, and "
"uses ``OLD`` behavior.  If a destination path contains a generator "
"expression, no such warning will be issued regardless of the value."
