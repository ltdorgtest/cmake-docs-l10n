"CMake 3.30 and earlier did not reserve ``codegen`` as a builtin target name, "
"leaving projects free to create their own target with that name. CMake 3.31 "
"and later prefer to reserve ``codegen`` as a builtin target name to drive "
"custom commands created with the ``CODEGEN`` option to :command:"
"`add_custom_command`.  In order to support building the ``codegen`` target "
"in scripted environments, e.g., ``cmake --build . --target codegen``, the "
"``codegen`` target needs to be generated even if no custom commands use the "
"``CODEGEN`` option.  This policy provides compatibility for projects that "
"have not been updated to avoid creating a target named ``codegen``."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy allows projects to create a target with "
"the name ``codegen``.  The ``NEW`` behavior halts with a fatal error if a "
"target with the name ``codegen`` is created."
