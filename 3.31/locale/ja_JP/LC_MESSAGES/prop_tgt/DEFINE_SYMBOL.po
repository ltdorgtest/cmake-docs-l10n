"``DEFINE_SYMBOL`` sets the name of the preprocessor symbol defined when "
"compiling sources in a shared library.  If not set here then it is set to "
"``target_EXPORTS`` by default (with some substitutions if the target is not "
"a valid C identifier).  This is useful for headers to know whether they are "
"being included from inside their library or outside to properly setup "
"dllexport/dllimport decorations on Windows."
