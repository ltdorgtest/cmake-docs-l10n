"This property specifies the list of libraries or targets which will be used "
"for linking.  In addition to accepting values from the :command:"
"`target_link_libraries` command, values may be set directly on any target "

"The value of this property is used by the generators to construct the link "
"rule for the target.  The direct link dependencies are linked first, "
"followed by indirect dependencies from the transitive closure of the direct "
"dependencies' :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` properties. See policy :"

"A call to :command:`target_link_libraries(<target> ...)` may update this "
"property on ``<target>``.  If ``<target>`` was not created in the same "
"directory as the call then :command:`target_link_libraries` will wrap each "
"entry with the form ``::@(directory-id);...;::@``, where the ``::@`` is "
"literal and the ``(directory-id)`` is unspecified. This tells the generators "
"that the named libraries must be looked up in the scope of the caller rather "
"than in the scope in which the ``<target>`` was created.  Valid directory "
"ids are stripped on export by the :command:`install(EXPORT)` and :command:"
"`export` commands."
