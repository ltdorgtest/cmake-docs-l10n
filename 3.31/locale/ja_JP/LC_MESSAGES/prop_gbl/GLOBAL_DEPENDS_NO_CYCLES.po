"CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target dependency graph at the "
"beginning of native build system generation.  It reports an error if the "
"dependency graph contains a cycle that does not consist of all STATIC "
"library targets.  This property tells CMake to disallow all cycles "
"completely, even among static libraries."
