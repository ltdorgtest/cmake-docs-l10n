"Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a project have globally "
"unique logical names (see policy :policy:`CMP0002`). This is necessary to "
"generate meaningful project file names in :generator:`Xcode` and :ref:"
"`Visual Studio Generators` IDE generators.  It also allows the target names "
"to be referenced unambiguously."

"Makefile generators are capable of supporting duplicate :command:"
"`add_custom_target` names.  For projects that care only about :ref:`Makefile "
"Generators` and do not wish to support :generator:`Xcode` or :ref:`Visual "
"Studio Generators` IDE generators, one may set this property to ``True`` to "
"allow duplicate custom targets.  The property allows multiple :command:"
"`add_custom_target` command calls in different directories to specify the "
"same target name.  However, setting this property will cause non-Makefile "
"generators to produce an error and refuse to generate the project."
