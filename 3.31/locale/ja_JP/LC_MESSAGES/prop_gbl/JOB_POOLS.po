"A pool is a named integer property and defines the maximum number of "
"concurrent jobs which can be started by a rule assigned to the pool. The "
"``JOB_POOLS`` property is a semicolon-separated list of pairs using the "

"Defined pools could be used globally by setting :variable:"
"`CMAKE_JOB_POOL_COMPILE` and :variable:`CMAKE_JOB_POOL_LINK` or per target "

"`JOB_POOL_LINK`. :command:`Custom commands <add_custom_command>` and :"
"command:`custom targets <add_custom_target>` can specify pools using the "
