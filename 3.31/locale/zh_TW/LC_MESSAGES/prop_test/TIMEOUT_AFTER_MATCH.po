msgid ""
"When the test outputs a line that matches ``regex`` its start time is reset "
"to the current time and its timeout duration is changed to ``seconds``.  "
"Prior to this, the timeout duration is determined by the :prop_test:"
"`TIMEOUT` property or the :variable:`CTEST_TEST_TIMEOUT` variable if either "
"of these are set.  Because the test's start time is reset, its execution "
"time will not include any time that was spent waiting for the matching "
"output."

msgid ""
"``TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH`` is useful for avoiding spurious timeouts when your "
"test must wait for some system resource to become available before it can "
"execute.  Set :prop_test:`TIMEOUT` to a longer duration that accounts for "
"resource acquisition and use ``TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH`` to control how long the "
"actual test is allowed to run."

"If the required resource can be controlled by CTest you should use :"
"prop_test:`RESOURCE_LOCK` instead of ``TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH``. This property "
"should be used when only the test itself can determine when its required "
"resources are available."
