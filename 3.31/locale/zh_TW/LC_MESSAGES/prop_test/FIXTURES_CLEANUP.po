"If CTest is asked to run only a subset of tests (e.g. using regular "

"A cleanup test can have multiple fixtures listed in its ``FIXTURES_CLEANUP`` "
"property. It will execute only once for the whole CTest run, not once for "

"there are multiple cleanup tests for a fixture, projects can control their "
"order with the usual :prop_test:`DEPENDS` test property if necessary."
