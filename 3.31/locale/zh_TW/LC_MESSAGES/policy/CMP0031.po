"This command was added in August 2002 to allow projects to add arbitrary "
"commands implemented in C or C++.  However, it does not work when the "
"toolchain in use does not match the ABI of the CMake process.  It has been "
"mostly superseded by the :command:`macro` and :command:`function` commands."

"CMake >= |disallowed_version| prefer that this command never be called. The "
