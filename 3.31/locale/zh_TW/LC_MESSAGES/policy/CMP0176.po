msgid ""
"The ``ENCODING`` option is meaningful only on Windows.  It specifies the "
"character encoding expected in the process's output on stdout and stderr. In "
"CMake 3.14 and below the default encoding was ``NONE``, which corresponds to "
"CMake's internal UTF-8 encoding.  In CMake 3.15 through CMake 3.30 the "
"default encoding was accidentally changed to ``AUTO``, but the change went "
"unnoticed and was not documented."

"CMake 3.31 and above prefer the ``ENCODING`` default to be ``UTF-8``. This "
"policy provides compatibility with projects that may have been relying on "
"the default being ``AUTO``."

msgid ""
"The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for :command:`execute_process` to use "
"``AUTO`` by default if no ``ENCODING`` is specified.  The ``NEW`` behavior "
"for this policy is to use ``UTF-8`` as the default ``ENCODING``."

"and uses ``OLD`` behavior."
