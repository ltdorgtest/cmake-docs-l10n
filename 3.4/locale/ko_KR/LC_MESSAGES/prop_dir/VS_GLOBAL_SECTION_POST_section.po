"This property only works for Visual Studio 7 and above; it is ignored on "

"Note that CMake generates postSolution sections ExtensibilityGlobals and "
"ExtensibilityAddIns by default.  If you set the corresponding property, it "
"will override the default section.  For example, setting "
"VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_ExtensibilityGlobals will override the default "
"contents of the ExtensibilityGlobals section, while keeping "
"ExtensibilityAddIns on its default."
