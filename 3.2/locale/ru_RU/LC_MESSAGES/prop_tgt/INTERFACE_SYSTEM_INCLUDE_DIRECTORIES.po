"Targets may populate this property to publish the include directories which "
"contain system headers, and therefore should not result in compiler "
"warnings.  The :command:`target_include_directories(SYSTEM)` command "
"signature populates this property with values given to the ``PUBLIC`` and "
"``INTERFACE`` keywords."

"Projects may also get and set the property directly, but must be aware that "
"adding directories to this property does not make those directories used "
"during compilation.  Adding directories to this property marks directories "
"as ``SYSTEM`` which otherwise would be used in a non-``SYSTEM`` manner.  "
"This can appear similar to 'duplication', so prefer the high-level :command:"
"`target_include_directories(SYSTEM)` command and avoid setting the property "
"by low-level means."

"When target dependencies are specified using :command:"
"`target_link_libraries`, CMake will read this property from all target "
"dependencies to mark the same include directories as containing system "
"headers."
