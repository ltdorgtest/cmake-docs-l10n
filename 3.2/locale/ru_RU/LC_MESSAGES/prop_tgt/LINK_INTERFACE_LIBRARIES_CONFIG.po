"Dependencies must provide their own :ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported "
"Targets>` which have their own :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION` populated "
"appropriately.  That way, when a consumer uses the installed package, the "
"consumer will run the appropriate :command:`find_package` command to find "
"the dependencies on their own machine and populate the :ref:`IMPORTED "
"targets <Imported Targets>` with appropriate paths.  See :ref:`Creating "
"Packages` for more.  Note that many modules currently shipped with CMake do "
"not currently provide :ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported Targets>`."
