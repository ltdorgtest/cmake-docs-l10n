"Some CMake generators support a target platform name to be given to the "
"native build system to choose a compiler toolchain. If the user specifies a "
"toolset name (e.g. via the cmake -A option) the value will be available in "
"this variable."

"The value of this variable should never be modified by project code. A "
"toolchain file specified by the :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` variable "
"may initialize ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM``.  Once a given build tree has "
"been initialized with a particular value for this variable, changing the "
"value has undefined behavior."
