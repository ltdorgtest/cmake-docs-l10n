"If find_package is called without an explicit mode option (MODULE, CONFIG or "
"NO_MODULE) and no Find<pkg>.cmake module is in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH then CMake "
"implicitly assumes that the caller intends to search for a package "
"configuration file.  If no package configuration file is found then the "
"wording of the failure message must account for both the case that the "
"package is really missing and the case that the project has a bug and failed "
"to provide the intended Find module.  If instead the caller specifies an "
"explicit mode option then the failure message can be more specific."

"Set CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE to TRUE to tell find_package to warn "
"when it implicitly assumes Config mode.  This helps developers enforce use "
"of an explicit mode in all calls to find_package within a project."
