"``find_dependency()`` wraps a :command:`find_package` call for a package "
"dependency. It is designed to be used in a <package>Config.cmake file, and "
"it forwards the correct parameters for EXACT, QUIET and REQUIRED which were "
"passed to the original :command:`find_package` call.  It also sets an "
"informative diagnostic message if the dependency could not be found."
