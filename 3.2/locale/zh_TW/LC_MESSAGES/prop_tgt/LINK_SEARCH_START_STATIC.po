"Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic and -Bdynamic to determine "
"whether to use static or shared libraries for -lXXX options. CMake uses "
"these options to set the link type for libraries whose full paths are not "
"known or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for the platform.  "
"By default the linker search type is assumed to be -Bdynamic at the "
"beginning of the library list.  This property switches the assumption to -"
"Bstatic.  It is intended for use when linking an executable statically (e."
"g.  with the GNU -static option).  See also LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC."
