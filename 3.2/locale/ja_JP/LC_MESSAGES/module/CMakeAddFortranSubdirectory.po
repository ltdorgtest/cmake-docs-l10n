"The 'add_fortran_subdirectory' function adds a subdirectory to a project "
"that contains a fortran only sub-project.  The module will check the current "
"compiler and see if it can support fortran.  If no fortran compiler is found "
"and the compiler is MSVC, then this module will find the MinGW gfortran.  It "
"will then use an external project to build with the MinGW tools.  It will "
"also create imported targets for the libraries created.  This will only work "
"if the fortran code is built into a dll, so BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is turned on "
"in the project. In addition the CMAKE_GNUtoMS option is set to on, so that "
"the MS .lib files are created.  Usage is as follows:"
