"CMake 2.8.12 and newer has support for using ``@rpath`` in a target's "
"install name.  This was enabled by setting the target property :prop_tgt:"
"`MACOSX_RPATH`.  The ``@rpath`` in an install name is a more flexible and "
"powerful mechanism than ``@executable_path`` or ``@loader_path`` for "
"locating shared libraries."

"CMake 3.0 and later prefer this property to be ON by default.  Projects "
"wanting ``@rpath`` in a target's install name may remove any setting of the :"
"prop_tgt:`INSTALL_NAME_DIR` and :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR` variables."

"set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:`cmake_minimum_required`. If it "
"was not set, CMake |WARNED_OR_DID_NOT_WARN|, and used ``OLD`` behavior."
