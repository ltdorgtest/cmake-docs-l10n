"CMake 2.8.8 and lower compiled sources in ``SHARED`` and ``MODULE`` "
"libraries using the value of the undocumented "
"``CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS`` platform variable.  The variable "
"contained platform-specific flags needed to compile objects for shared "
"libraries.  Typically it included a flag such as ``-fPIC`` for position "
"independent code but also included other flags needed on certain platforms.  "
"CMake 2.8.9 and higher prefer instead to use the :prop_tgt:"
"`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` target property to determine what targets should "
"be position independent, and new undocumented platform variables to select "
"flags while ignoring ``CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS`` completely."
