"This policy determines whether or not CMake should generate escaped "
"preprocessor definition values added via add_definitions.  CMake versions "
"2.4 and below assumed that only trivial values would be given for macros in "
"add_definitions calls.  It did not attempt to escape non-trivial values such "
"as string literals in generated build rules. CMake versions 2.6 and above "
"support escaping of most values, but cannot assume the user has not added "
"escapes already in an attempt to work around limitations in earlier versions."

msgid ""
"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to place definition values given to "
"add_definitions directly in the generated build rules without attempting to "
"escape anything.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to generate "
"correct escapes for all native build tools automatically. See documentation "
"of the ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` target property for limitations of the "
"escaping implementation."

"Prior to removal in CMake version |REMOVED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|, it could be "
"set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:`cmake_minimum_required`. If it "
"was not set, CMake |WARNED_OR_DID_NOT_WARN|, and used ``OLD`` behavior."
