"Starting with CMake 2.8.4, if a cmake-module shipped with CMake (i.e. "
"located in the CMake module directory) calls include() or find_package(), "
"the files located in the CMake module directory are preferred over the files "
"in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.  This makes sure that the modules belonging to CMake "
"always get those files included which they expect, and against which they "
"were developed and tested.  In all other cases, the files found in "
"CMAKE_MODULE_PATH still take precedence over the ones in the CMake module "
"directory.  The OLD behavior is to always prefer files from "
"CMAKE_MODULE_PATH over files from the CMake modules directory."
