"In CMake 2.6.2 and below, incorrect variable reference syntax such as a "
"missing close-brace (``${FOO``) was reported but did not stop processing of "
"CMake code.  This policy determines whether a bad variable reference is an "
"error.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to warn about the error, "
"leave the string untouched, and continue. The ``NEW`` behavior for this "
"policy is to report an error."

"If :policy:`CMP0053` is set to ``NEW``, this policy has no effect and is "
"treated as always being ``NEW``."

msgid ""
"This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.3.  CMake version |release| "
"warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use the :"
"command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly."
