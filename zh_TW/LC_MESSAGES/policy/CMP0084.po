"The existence of :module:`FindQt` means that for Qt upstream to provide "
"package config files that can be found by ``find_package(Qt)``, the "
"consuming project has to explicitly specify ``find_package(Qt CONFIG)``. "
"Removing this module gives Qt a path forward for exporting its own config "
"files which can easily be found by consuming projects."

"This policy pretends that CMake's internal :module:`FindQt` module does not "
"exist for :command:`find_package`. If a project really wants to use Qt 3 or "
"4, it can call ``find_package(Qt[34])``, ``include(FindQt)``, or add :module:"
"`FindQt` to their :variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`."
