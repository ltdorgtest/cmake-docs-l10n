msgid ""
"The :module:`FindOpenGL` module provides an ``OpenGL::GL`` target and an "
"``OPENGL_LIBRARIES`` variable for projects to use for legacy GL interfaces. "
"When both a legacy GL library (e.g. ``libGL.so``) and GLVND libraries for "
"OpenGL and GLX (e.g. ``libOpenGL.so`` and ``libGLX.so``) are available, the "
"module must choose between them.  It documents an ``OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE`` "
"variable that can be used to specify an explicit preference.  When no such "
"preference is set, the module must choose a default preference."

"CMake 3.11 and above prefer to choose GLVND libraries.  This policy provides "
"compatibility with projects that expect the legacy GL library to be used."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to set ``OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE`` to "
"``LEGACY``.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to set "
"``OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE`` to ``GLVND``."
