":prop_sf:`LANGUAGE` source file property explicitly compiles as specified "

"The :prop_sf:`LANGUAGE` source file property is documented to mean that the "
"source file is written in the specified language.  In CMake 3.19 and below, "
"setting this property causes CMake to compile the source file using the "
"compiler for the specified language.  However, it only passes an explicit "
"flag to tell the compiler to treat the source as the specified language for "
"MSVC-like, XL, and Embarcadero compilers for the ``CXX`` language. CMake "
"3.20 and above prefer to also explicitly tell the compiler to use the "
"specified language using a flag such as ``-x c`` on all compilers for which "
"such flags are known."

"This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated "
"to expect this behavior.  For example, some projects were setting the "
"``LANGUAGE`` property to ``C`` on assembly-language ``.S`` source files in "
"order to compile them using the C compiler.  Such projects should be updated "
"to use ``enable_language(ASM)``, for which CMake will often choose the C "
"compiler as the assembler on relevant platforms anyway."
