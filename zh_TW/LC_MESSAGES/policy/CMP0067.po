"The :command:`try_compile` source file signature is intended to allow "
"callers to check whether they will be able to compile a given source file "
"with the current toolchain.  In order to match compiler behavior, any "
"language standard mode should match.  However, CMake 3.7 and below did not "
"do this.  CMake 3.8 and above prefer to honor the language standard settings "
"for ``C``, ``CXX`` (C++), and ``CUDA`` using the values of the variables:"
