"Earlier versions of these commands always treated relative paths in "
"``GIT_REPOSITORY`` as local paths, but the base directory it was treated as "
"relative to was both undocumented and unintuitive.  The ``OLD`` behavior for "
"this policy is to interpret relative paths used for ``GIT_REPOSITORY`` as "
"local paths relative to the following:"

"The ``NEW`` behavior is to determine the remote from the parent project and "
"interpret the path relative to that remote.  The value of :variable:"
"`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` when :command:`ExternalProject_Add` or :command:"
