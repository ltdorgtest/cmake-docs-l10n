"CMake 3.12 and lower allowed the :prop_dir:`LINK_DIRECTORIES` directory "
"property to contain relative paths.  The base path for such relative entries "
"is not well defined.  CMake 3.13 and later will issue a ``FATAL_ERROR`` if "
"the :prop_tgt:`LINK_DIRECTORIES` target property (which is initialized by "
"the :prop_dir:`LINK_DIRECTORIES` directory property) contains a relative "
"path."
