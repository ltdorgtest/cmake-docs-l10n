"CMake 2.8.11 constructed the 'link interface' of a target from properties "
"matching ``(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)?``. The modern "
"way to specify config-sensitive content is to use generator expressions and "
"the ``IMPORTED_`` prefix makes uniform processing of the link interface with "
"generator expressions impossible.  The INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES target "
"property was introduced as a replacement in CMake 2.8.12.  This new property "
"is named consistently with the INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS, "
"INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS properties.  For "
"in-build targets, CMake will use the INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property as "
"the source of the link interface only if policy CMP0022 is NEW.  When "
"exporting a target which has this policy set to NEW, only the "
"INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property will be processed and generated for the "
"IMPORTED target by default.  A new option to the install(EXPORT) and export "
"commands allows export of the old-style properties for compatibility with "
"downstream users of CMake versions older than 2.8.12.  The "
"target_link_libraries command will no longer populate the properties "
"matching LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)? if this policy is NEW."

"The OLD behavior for this policy is to ignore the INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES "
"property for in-build targets.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to use "
"the INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property for in-build targets, and ignore the "
"old properties matching ``(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)?``."
