"The Swift compiler can compile modules in different modes. The desired build "
"mode depends whether the developer is iterating and wants to incrementally "
"make changes, or if they are building a release for distribution and want "
"more optimizations applied to the resulting binary."

"CMake versions 3.26 through 3.28 build Swift binaries with whole-module "
"optimizations enabled when configured in a non-debug build type. For CMake "
"versions earlier than 3.26, the developer needs to specify the necessary "
"flag manually for the :ref:`Ninja Generators`, and cannot not specify whole-"
"module optimizations to the :generator:`Xcode` generator."

"CMake versions 3.29 and above prefer to set the compilation mode using the :"
"prop_tgt:`Swift_COMPILATION_MODE` target property, which can be initialized "
"by the :variable:`CMAKE_Swift_COMPILATION_MODE` variable."

"This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated. "

"Once the policy has taken effect at the top of a project, that choice must "

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy builds all Swift targets in "
"``wholemodule`` mode for non-debug configurations.  :ref:`Ninja Generators` "
"prepend the ``-wmo`` flag to the default set of Swift flags. The :generator:"
"`Xcode` generator sets the ``SWIFT_COMPILATION_MODE`` attribute to "
"``wholemodule`` in the generated Xcode project file."

"The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to apply the compilation mode "
