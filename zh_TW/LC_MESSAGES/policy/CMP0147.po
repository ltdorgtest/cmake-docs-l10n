"Visual Studio 15.8 (2017) and newer support building custom commands in "
"parallel.  CMake 3.27 and above prefer to enable this behavior by adding a "
"``BuildInParallel`` setting to custom commands in ``.vcxproj`` files. This "
"policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated to "
"expect this, e.g., because their custom commands were accidentally relying "
"on serial execution by MSBuild."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to not add ``BuildInParallel``. The "
"``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to add ``BuildInParallel`` for VS 15.8 "
"and newer."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.27.  Use the :command:"
"`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly. Unlike "
"many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn when this policy is "
"not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-"
