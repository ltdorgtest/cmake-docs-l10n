"A property on a source file that indicates if the source file is a header "
"file with no associated implementation.  This is set automatically based on "
"the file extension and is used by CMake to determine if certain dependency "
"information should be computed."

"By setting this property to ``ON``, you can disable compilation of the given "
"source file, even if it should be compiled because it is part of the "
"library's/executable's sources."

"This is useful if you have some source files which you somehow pre-process, "
"and then add these pre-processed sources via :command:`add_library` or :"
"command:`add_executable`. Normally, in IDE, there would be no reference of "
"the original sources, only of these pre-processed sources. So by setting "
"this property for all the original source files to ``ON``, and then either "
"calling :command:`add_library` or :command:`add_executable` while passing "
"both the pre-processed sources and the original sources, or by using :"
"command:`target_sources` to add original source files will do exactly what "
"would one expect, i.e. the original source files would be visible in IDE, "
"and will not be built."
