"In addition to accepting values from that command, values may be set "
"directly on any directory using the :command:`set_property` command, and can "
"be set on the current directory using the :command:"
"`set_directory_properties` command.  A directory gets its initial value from "
"its parent directory if it has one.  The initial value of the :prop_tgt:"
"`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` target property comes from the value of this "
"property.  Both directory and target property values are adjusted by calls "
"to the :command:`include_directories` command. Calls to :command:"
"`set_property` or :command:`set_directory_properties`, however, will update "
"the directory property value without updating target property values.  "
"Therefore direct property updates must be made before calls to :command:"
"`add_executable` or :command:`add_library` for targets they are meant to "
"affect."
