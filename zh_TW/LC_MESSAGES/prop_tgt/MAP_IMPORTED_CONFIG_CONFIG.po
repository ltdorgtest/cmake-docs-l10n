"Set this to the list of configurations of an imported target that may be "
"used for the current project's <CONFIG> configuration.  Targets imported "
"from another project may not provide the same set of configuration names "
"available in the current project.  Setting this property tells CMake what "
"imported configurations are suitable for use when building the <CONFIG> "
"configuration.  The first configuration in the list found to be provided by "
"the imported target is selected.  If this property is set and no matching "
"configurations are available, then the imported target is considered to be "
"not found.  This property is ignored for non-imported targets."
