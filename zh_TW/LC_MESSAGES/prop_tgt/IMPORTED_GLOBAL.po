"The boolean value of this property is True for targets created with the "
"``IMPORTED`` ``GLOBAL`` options to :command:`add_executable()` or :command:"
"`add_library()`. It is always False for targets built within the project."

"For targets created with the ``IMPORTED`` option to :command:"
"`add_executable()` or :command:`add_library()` but without the additional "
"option ``GLOBAL`` this is False, too. However, setting this property for "
"such a locally ``IMPORTED`` target to True promotes that target to global "
"scope. This promotion can only be done in the same directory where that "
"``IMPORTED`` target was created in the first place."

msgid ""
"Once an imported target has been made global, it cannot be changed back to "
"non-global. Therefore, if a project sets this property, it may only provide "
"a value of True. CMake will issue an error if the project tries to set the "
"property to a non-True value, even if the value was already False."
