"Link dependency files usage requirements commonly differ between the build-"
"tree and the install-tree.  The ``BUILD_INTERFACE`` and "
"``INSTALL_INTERFACE`` generator expressions can be used to describe separate "
"usage requirements based on the usage location.  Relative paths are allowed "
"within the ``INSTALL_INTERFACE`` expression and are interpreted relative to "
"the installation prefix.  For example:"
