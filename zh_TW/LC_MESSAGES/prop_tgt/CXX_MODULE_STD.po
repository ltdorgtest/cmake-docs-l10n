"``CXX_MODULE_STD`` is a boolean specifying whether the target may use "
"``import std;`` its C++ sources or not."

"This setting is meaningful only when experimental support for ``import std;"
"`` has been enabled by the ``CMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX_IMPORT_STD`` gate."

"When this property is explicitly set to ``ON``, CMake will add a dependency "
"to a target which provides the C++ standard library's modules for the C++ "
"standard applied to the target. This target is only applicable within the "
"current build and will not appear in the exported interfaces of the targets. "
"When consumed, these targets will be reapplied as necessary."

"Similar to the introduction of :prop_tgt:`CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES`, this "
"property defaults to **not** adding ``import std`` support to targets using "
"``cxx_std_23`` without an explicit request in order to preserve existing "
"behavior for projects using C++23 without ``import std``. A future policy to "
"change the default behavior is expected once the feature sees wider usage."

msgid ""
"This property's value is not relevant for targets which disable scanning "
"(see :prop_tgt:`CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES`). Additionally, this property only "
"applies to targets utilizing C++23 (``cxx_std_23``) or newer."

msgid ""
"The property supports :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-"
"expressions(7)>`, however expressions that depend upon the configuration, "
"the consuming target, or the linker language are not allowed. Whether a "
"target uses ``import std`` should not depend upon such things as it is a "
"static property of the target's source code."
