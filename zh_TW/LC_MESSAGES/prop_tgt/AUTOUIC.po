"``AUTOUIC`` is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle the Qt ``uic`` "
"code generator automatically, i.e. without having to use the :module:"
"`QT4_WRAP_UI() <FindQt4>` or ``QT5_WRAP_UI()`` macro. Currently Qt4 and Qt5 "
"are supported."

msgid ""
"When this property is ``ON``, CMake will scan the source files at build time "
"and invoke ``uic`` accordingly.  If an ``#include`` statement like "
"``#include \"ui_foo.h\"`` is found in ``foo.cpp``, a ``foo.ui`` file is "
"expected next to ``foo.cpp``, and ``uic`` is run on the ``foo.ui`` file. "
"This property is initialized by the value of the :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOUIC` "
"variable if it is set when a target is created."

#: ../../../prop_tgt/AUTOUIC.rst:18
msgid ""
"Additional command line options for ``uic`` can be set via the :prop_sf:"
"`AUTOUIC_OPTIONS` source file property on the ``foo.ui`` file. The global "
"property :prop_gbl:`AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER` can be used to group the autouic "
"targets together in an IDE, e.g. in MSVS."
