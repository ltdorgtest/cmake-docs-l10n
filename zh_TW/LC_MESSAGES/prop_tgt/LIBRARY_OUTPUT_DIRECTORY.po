"There are three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, "
"and runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime targets.  Static "
"libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module libraries are always "
"treated as library targets.  For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are "
"treated as library targets.  For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared "
"library is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import library "
"is treated as an archive target.  All Windows-based systems including Cygwin "
"are DLL platforms."
