"When a target is being installed, CMake may need to rewrite its rpath "
"information.  This occurs when the install rpath (as specified by the :"
"prop_tgt:`INSTALL_RPATH` target property) has different contents to the "
"rpath that the target was built with.  Some toolchains insert their own "
"rpath contents into the binary as part of the build.  By default, CMake will "
"preserve those extra inserted contents in the install rpath.  For those "
"scenarios where such toolchain-inserted entries need to be discarded during "
"install, set the ``INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH`` target property to "
"true."
