"Default compilation flags to be used when compiling ``C`` files. Will only "
"be used by CMake on the first configuration to determine ``CC`` default "
"compilation flags, after which the value for ``CFLAGS`` is stored in the "
"cache as :variable:`CMAKE_C_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>`. For any "
"configuration run (including the first), the environment variable will be "
"ignored if the :variable:`CMAKE_C_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>` variable is "
