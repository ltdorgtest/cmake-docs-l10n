"This property specifies whether Makefile generators should add a progress "
"message describing what each build rule does.  If the property is not set "
"the default is ON.  Set the property to OFF to disable granular messages and "
"report only as each target completes. This is intended to allow scripted "
"builds to avoid the build time cost of detailed reports.  If a :variable:"
"`CMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES` cache entry exists its value initializes the value of "
"this property.  Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this property."
