"This property describes the cost of a test.  When parallel testing is "
"enabled, tests in the test set will be run in descending order of cost. "
"Projects can explicitly define the cost of a test by setting this property "
"to a floating point value."

msgid ""
"When the cost of a test is not defined by the project, :manual:`ctest "
"<ctest(1)>` will initially use a default cost of ``0``. It computes a "
"weighted average of the cost each time a test is run and uses that as an "
"improved estimate of the cost for the next run.  The more a test is re-run "
"in the same build directory, the more representative the cost should become."
