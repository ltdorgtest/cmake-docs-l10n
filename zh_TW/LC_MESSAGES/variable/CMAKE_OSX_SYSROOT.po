"Specify the location or name of the macOS platform SDK to be used. CMake "
"uses this value to compute the value of the ``-isysroot`` flag or equivalent "
"and to help the ``find_*`` commands locate files in the SDK."

"If not set explicitly, the value is initialized by the ``SDKROOT`` "
"environment variable, if set.  Otherwise, the value defaults to empty, so no "
"explicit ``-isysroot`` flag is passed, and the compiler's default sysroot is "
"used."

"Xcode's compilers, when not invoked with ``-isysroot``, search for headers "
"in ``/usr/local/include`` before system SDK paths, matching the convention "
"on many platforms.  Users on macOS-x86_64 hosts with Homebrew installed in "
"``/usr/local`` should pass ``-DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=macosx``, or ``export "
"SDKROOT=macosx``, when not building with Homebrew tools."

"The value of this variable should be set prior to the first :command:"
"`project` or :command:`enable_language` command invocation because it may "
"influence configuration of the toolchain and flags. It is intended to be set "
"locally by the user creating a build tree. This variable should be set as a "
"``CACHE`` entry (or else CMake may remove it while initializing a cache "
"entry of the same name) unless policy :policy:`CMP0126` is set to ``NEW``."
