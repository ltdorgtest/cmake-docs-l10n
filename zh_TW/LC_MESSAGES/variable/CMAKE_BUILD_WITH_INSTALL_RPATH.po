"Normally CMake uses the build tree for the ``RPATH`` when building "
"executables etc on systems that use ``RPATH``.  When the software is "
"installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the install "
"``RPATH``.  If this variable is set to true then the software is always "
"built with the install path for the ``RPATH`` and does not need to be "
"relinked when installed."
