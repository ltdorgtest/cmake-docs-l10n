"By default, the ``install`` target depends on the ``all`` target.  This has "
"the effect, that when ``make install`` is invoked or ``INSTALL`` is built, "
"first the ``all`` target is built, then the installation starts. If "
"``CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY`` is set to ``TRUE``, this dependency is "
"not created, so the installation process will start immediately, independent "
"from whether the project has been completely built or not."
