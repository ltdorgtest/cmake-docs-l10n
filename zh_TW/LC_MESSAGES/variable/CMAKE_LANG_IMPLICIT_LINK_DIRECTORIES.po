"Compilers typically pass directories containing language runtime libraries "
"and default library search paths when they invoke a linker. These paths are "
"implicit linker search directories for the compiler's language.  CMake "
"automatically detects these directories for each language and reports the "
"results in this variable."

"Some toolchains read implicit directories from an environment variable such "
"as ``LIBRARY_PATH``.  If using such an environment variable, keep its value "
"consistent when operating in a given build tree because CMake saves the "
"value detected when first creating a build tree."

"If policy :policy:`CMP0060` is not set to ``NEW``, then when a library in "
"one of these directories is given by full path to :command:"
"`target_link_libraries` CMake will generate the ``-l<name>`` form on link "
"lines for historical purposes."
