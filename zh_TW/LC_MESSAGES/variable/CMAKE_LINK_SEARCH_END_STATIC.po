"Some linkers support switches such as ``-Bstatic`` and ``-Bdynamic`` to "
"determine whether to use static or shared libraries for ``-lXXX`` options. "
"CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full paths "
"are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for the "
"platform.  By default CMake adds an option at the end of the library list "
"(if necessary) to set the linker search type back to its starting type.  "
"This property switches the final linker search type to ``-Bstatic`` "
"regardless of how it started."
