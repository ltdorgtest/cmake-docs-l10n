"Gets a property from a source file.  The value of the property is stored in "
"the specified ``<variable>``.  If the source property is not found, the "
"behavior depends on whether it has been defined to be an ``INHERITED`` "
"property or not (see :command:`define_property`).  Non-inherited properties "
"will set ``variable`` to ``NOTFOUND``, whereas inherited properties will "
"search the relevant parent scope as described for the :command:"
"`define_property` command and if still unable to find the property, "
"``variable`` will be set to an empty string."
