"Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP in your configuration "
"and no SDL_LIBRARY, it means CMake did not find your SDL library (SDL.dll, "
"libsdl.so, SDL.framework, etc).  Set SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP to point to your SDL "
"library, and configure again. Similarly, if you see an empty "
"SDLMAIN_LIBRARY, you should set this value as appropriate.  These values are "
"used to generate the final SDL_LIBRARY variable, but when these values are "
"unset, SDL_LIBRARY does not get created."

"Modified by Eric Wing.  Added code to assist with automated building by "
"using environmental variables and providing a more controlled/consistent "
"search behavior.  Added new modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and "
"additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc). Also corrected the header search path "
"to follow \"proper\" SDL guidelines.  Added a search for SDLmain which is "
"needed by some platforms.  Added a search for threads which is needed by "
"some platforms.  Added needed compile switches for MinGW."

"Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to just SDL.h This "

"not <SDL/SDL.h>.  This is done for portability reasons because not all "
"systems place things in SDL/ (see FreeBSD)."
