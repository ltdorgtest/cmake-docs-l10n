"TYPE: What type of dependency has the using project on that package. Default "
"is OPTIONAL.  In this case it is a package which can be used by the project "

"similar to OPTIONAL, i.e.  the project will build if the package is not "
"present, but the functionality of the resulting binaries will be severly "
"limited.  If a REQUIRED package is not available at buildtime, the project "
"may not even build.  This can be combined with the "
"FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES argument for feature_summary().  Last, a "
