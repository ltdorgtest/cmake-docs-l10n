"Add a list of subdirectories to the build.  The add_subdirectory command "
"should be used instead of subdirs although subdirs will still work.  This "
"will cause any CMakeLists.txt files in the sub directories to be processed "
"by CMake.  Any directories after the PREORDER flag are traversed first by "
"makefile builds, the PREORDER flag has no effect on IDE projects.  Any "
"directories after the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL marker will not be included in the "
"top level makefile or project file.  This is useful for having CMake create "
"makefiles or projects for a set of examples in a project.  You would want "
"CMake to generate makefiles or project files for all the examples at the "
"same time, but you would not want them to show up in the top level project "
"or be built each time make is run from the top."
