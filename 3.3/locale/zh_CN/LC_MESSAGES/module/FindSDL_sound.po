"Created by Eric Wing.  This module is a bit more complicated than the other "
"FindSDL* family modules.  The reason is that SDL_sound can be compiled in a "
"large variety of different ways which are independent of platform.  "
"SDL_sound may dynamically link against other 3rd party libraries to get "
"additional codec support, such as Ogg Vorbis, SMPEG, ModPlug, MikMod, FLAC, "
"Speex, and potentially others.  Under some circumstances which I don't fully "
"understand, there seems to be a requirement that dependent libraries of "
"libraries you use must also be explicitly linked against in order to "
"successfully compile.  SDL_sound does not currently have any system in place "
"to know how it was compiled.  So this CMake module does the hard work in "
"trying to discover which 3rd party libraries are required for building (if "
"any). This module uses a brute force approach to create a test program that "
"uses SDL_sound, and then tries to build it.  If the build fails, it parses "
"the error output for known symbol names to figure out which libraries are "
"needed."
