"This module defines three macros: CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE() "
"CMAKE_POP_CHECK_STATE() and CMAKE_RESET_CHECK_STATE() These macros can be "
"used to save, restore and reset (i.e., clear contents) the state of the "
"variables CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS, CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS, "
"CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES and CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES used by the various "
"Check-files coming with CMake, like e.g. check_function_exists() etc.  The "
"variable contents are pushed on a stack, pushing multiple times is "
"supported.  This is useful e.g.  when executing such tests in a Find-module, "
"where they have to be set, but after the Find-module has been executed they "
"should have the same value as they had before."

"CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE() macro receives optional argument RESET. Whether "
"it's specified, CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE() will set all CMAKE_REQUIRED_* "
"variables to empty values, same as CMAKE_RESET_CHECK_STATE() call will do."
