"An :ref:`IMPORTED executable target <Imported Targets>` references an "
"executable file located outside the project.  No rules are generated to "
"build it, and the :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` target property is ``True``.  The "
"target name has scope in the directory in which it is created and below, but "
"the ``GLOBAL`` option extends visibility.  It may be referenced like any "
"target built within the project.  ``IMPORTED`` executables are useful for "
"convenient reference from commands like :command:`add_custom_command`. "
"Details about the imported executable are specified by setting properties "
"whose names begin in ``IMPORTED_``.  The most important such property is :"
"prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION` (and its per-configuration version :prop_tgt:"
"`IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>`) which specifies the location of the main "
"executable file on disk.  See documentation of the ``IMPORTED_*`` properties "

"Creates an :ref:`Alias Target <Alias Targets>`, such that ``<name>`` can be "

"not appear in the generated buildsystem as a make target.  The ``<target>`` "
"may not be an :ref:`Imported Target <Imported Targets>` or an ``ALIAS``.  "
"``ALIAS`` targets can be used as targets to read properties from, "
"executables for custom commands and custom targets.  They can also be tested "
"for existence with the regular :command:`if(TARGET)` subcommand. The "
"``<name>`` may not be used to modify properties of ``<target>``, that is, it "
"may not be used as the operand of :command:`set_property`, :command:"
"`set_target_properties`, :command:`target_link_libraries` etc. An ``ALIAS`` "
"target may not be installed or exported."
