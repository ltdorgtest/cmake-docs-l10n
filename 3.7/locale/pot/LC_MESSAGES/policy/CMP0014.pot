"CMake versions before 2.8 silently ignored missing CMakeLists.txt files in "
"directories referenced by add_subdirectory() or subdirs(), treating them as "
"if present but empty.  In CMake 2.8.0 and above this policy determines "
"whether or not the case is an error.  The OLD behavior for this policy is to "
"silently ignore the problem.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to report "
"an error."
