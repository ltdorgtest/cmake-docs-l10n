"This module invokes the HDF5 wrapper compiler that should be installed "
"alongside HDF5.  Depending upon the HDF5 Configuration, the wrapper compiler "
"is called either h5cc or h5pcc.  If this succeeds, the module will then call "
"the compiler with the -show argument to see what flags are used when "
"compiling an HDF5 client application."

"The module will optionally accept the COMPONENTS argument.  If no COMPONENTS "
"are specified, then the find module will default to finding only the HDF5 C "
"library.  If one or more COMPONENTS are specified, the module will attempt "
"to find the language bindings for the specified components.  The only valid "
"components are C, CXX, Fortran, HL, and Fortran_HL.  If the COMPONENTS "
"argument is not given, the module will attempt to find only the C bindings."

"On UNIX systems, this module will read the variable "
"HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES to determine whether or not to prefer a static "
"link to a dynamic link for HDF5 and all of it's dependencies. To use this "
"feature, make sure that the HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES variable is set before "
"the call to find_package."

"To provide the module with a hint about where to find your HDF5 "
"installation, you can set the environment variable HDF5_ROOT.  The Find "
"module will then look in this path when searching for HDF5 executables, "
"paths, and libraries."

"Both the serial and parallel HDF5 wrappers are considered and the first "
"directory to contain either one will be used.  In the event that both appear "
"in the same directory the serial version is preferentially selected. This "
"behavior can be reversed by setting the variable HDF5_PREFER_PARALLEL to "
"true."

"In addition to finding the includes and libraries required to compile an "
