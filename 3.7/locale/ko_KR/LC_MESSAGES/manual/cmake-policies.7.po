"Policies in CMake are used to preserve backward compatible behavior across "
"multiple releases.  When a new policy is introduced, newer CMake versions "
"will begin to warn about the backward compatible behavior.  It is possible "
"to disable the warning by explicitly requesting the OLD, or backward "
"compatible behavior using the :command:`cmake_policy` command. It is also "
"possible to request ``NEW``, or non-backward compatible behavior for a "
"policy, also avoiding the warning.  Each policy can also be set to either "
"``NEW`` or ``OLD`` behavior explicitly on the command line with the :"
"variable:`CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>` variable."

"A policy is a deprecation mechanism and not a reliable feature toggle. A "
"policy should almost never be set to ``OLD``, except to silence warnings in "
"an otherwise frozen or stable codebase, or temporarily as part of a larger "
"migration path. The ``OLD`` behavior of each policy is undesirable and will "
"be replaced with an error condition in a future release."

"The :command:`cmake_minimum_required` command does more than report an error "
"if a too-old version of CMake is used to build a project.  It also sets all "
"policies introduced in that CMake version or earlier to ``NEW`` behavior.  "
"To manage policies without increasing the minimum required CMake version, "
"the :command:`if(POLICY)` command may be used:"

"This has the effect of using the ``NEW`` behavior with newer CMake releases "

"The setting of a policy is confined in some cases to not propagate to the "
"parent scope.  For example, if the files read by the :command:`include` "
"command or the :command:`find_package` command contain a use of :command:"
"`cmake_policy`, that policy setting will not affect the caller by default.  "
"Both commands accept an optional ``NO_POLICY_SCOPE`` keyword to control this "
"behavior."

"The :variable:`CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION` variable may also be used to "
