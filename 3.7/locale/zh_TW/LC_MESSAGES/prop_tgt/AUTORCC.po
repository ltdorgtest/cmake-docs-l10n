"``AUTORCC`` is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle the Qt ``rcc`` "
"code generator automatically, i.e. without having to use the :module:"
"`QT4_ADD_RESOURCES() <FindQt4>` or ``QT5_ADD_RESOURCES()`` macro.  Currently "
"Qt4 and Qt5 are supported."

"When this property is ``ON``, CMake will handle ``.qrc`` files added as "
"target sources at build time and invoke ``rcc`` accordingly. This property "
"is initialized by the value of the :variable:`CMAKE_AUTORCC` variable if it "
"is set when a target is created."

"Additional command line options for rcc can be set via the :prop_sf:"
"`AUTORCC_OPTIONS` source file property on the ``.qrc`` file."

"The global property :prop_gbl:`AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER` can be used to group "
"the autorcc targets together in an IDE, e.g. in MSVS."

msgid ""
"When there are multiple ``.qrc`` files with the same name, CMake will "
"generate unspecified unique names for ``rcc``.  Therefore if "
"``Q_INIT_RESOURCE()`` or ``Q_CLEANUP_RESOURCE()`` need to be used the ``."
"qrc`` file name must be unique."
