"Specifies the maximum number of source files that can be combined into any "
"one unity source file when unity builds are enabled by the :prop_tgt:"
"`UNITY_BUILD` target property.  The original source files will be "
"distributed across as many unity source files as necessary to honor this "
"limit."

"The initial value for this property is taken from the :variable:"
"`CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE` variable when the target is created. If that "
"variable has not been set, the initial value will be 8."

msgid ""
"The batch size needs to be selected carefully.  If set too high, the size of "
"the combined source files could result in the compiler using excessive "
"memory or hitting other similar limits.  In extreme cases, this can even "
"result in build failure.  On the other hand, if the batch size is too low, "
"there will be little gain in build performance."

#: ../../../prop_tgt/UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE.rst:21
msgid ""
"Although strongly discouraged, the batch size may be set to a value of 0 to "
"combine all the sources for the target into a single unity file, regardless "
"of how many sources are involved.  This runs the risk of creating an "
"excessively large unity source file and negatively impacting the build "
"performance, so a value of 0 is not generally recommended."
