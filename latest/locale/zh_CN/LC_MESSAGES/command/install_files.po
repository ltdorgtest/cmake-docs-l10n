"This command has been superseded by the :command:`install` command.  It is "
"provided for compatibility with older CMake code.  The ``FILES`` form is "
"directly replaced by the ``FILES`` form of the :command:`install` command.  "
"The regexp form can be expressed more clearly using the ``GLOB`` form of "
"the :command:`file` command."

"Create rules to install the listed files with the given extension into the "
"given directory.  Only files existing in the current source tree or its "
"corresponding location in the binary tree may be listed.  If a file "
"specified already has an extension, that extension will be removed first.  "
"This is useful for providing lists of source files such as foo.cxx when you "
"want the corresponding foo.h to be installed. A typical extension is ``.h``."
