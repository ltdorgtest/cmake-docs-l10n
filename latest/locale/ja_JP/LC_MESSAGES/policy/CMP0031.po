"This command was added in August 2002 to allow projects to add arbitrary "
"commands implemented in C or C++.  However, it does not work when the "
"toolchain in use does not match the ABI of the CMake process.  It has been "
"mostly superseded by the :command:`macro` and :command:`function` commands."

"CMake >= |disallowed_version| prefer that this command never be called. The "
"``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow the command to be called. The "
"``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to issue a ``FATAL_ERROR`` when the "
"command is called."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. "
"Prior to removal in CMake version |REMOVED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|, it could be "
"set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:`cmake_minimum_required`. If it "
"was not set, CMake |WARNED_OR_DID_NOT_WARN|, and used ``OLD`` behavior."
