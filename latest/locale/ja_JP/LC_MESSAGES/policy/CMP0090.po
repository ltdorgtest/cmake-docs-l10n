"In CMake 3.14 and below the :command:`export(PACKAGE)` command populated the "
"user package registry by default and users needed to set the :variable:"
"`CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY` to disable it, e.g. in automated build "
"and packaging environments.  Since the user package registry is stored "
"outside the build tree, this side effect should not be enabled by default. "
"Therefore CMake 3.15 and above prefer that :command:`export(PACKAGE)` does "
"nothing unless an explicit :variable:`CMAKE_EXPORT_PACKAGE_REGISTRY` "
"variable is set to enable it.  This policy provides compatibility with "
"projects that have not been updated."
