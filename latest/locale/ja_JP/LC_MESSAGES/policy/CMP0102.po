"In CMake 3.16 and below, if a variable was not defined at all or just "
"defined locally, the :command:`mark_as_advanced` command would create a new "
"cache entry with an ``UNINITIALIZED`` type and no value. When a :command:"
"`find_path` (or other similar ``find_`` command) would next run, it would "
"find this undefined cache entry and set it up with an empty string value. "
"This process would end up deleting the local variable in the process (due to "
"the way the cache works), effectively clearing any stored ``find_`` results "
"that were only available in the local scope."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to create the empty cache "
