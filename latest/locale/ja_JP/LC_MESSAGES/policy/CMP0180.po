"In CMake 3.29 and below, the :command:`project` command set :variable:"
"`<PROJECT-NAME>_SOURCE_DIR`, :variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_BINARY_DIR`, and :"
"variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_IS_TOP_LEVEL` as cache entries, but not as normal "
"variables.  CMake 3.30 started setting them as normal variables, but only if "
"they are already set as normal variables.  This was needed to preserve "
"support for some :module:`FetchContent` use cases under policy :policy:"
"`CMP0169`'s NEW behavior, while also preserving behavior of nested "
"directories that call :command:`project` with the same project name. See "
"release notes for 3.30.3, 3.30.4, and 3.30.5 for details."

"CMake 3.31 and later prefer to always set ``<PROJECT-NAME>_SOURCE_DIR``, "
"``<PROJECT-NAME>_BINARY_DIR``, and ``<PROJECT-NAME>_IS_TOP_LEVEL``, as both "
"cache entries and normal variables, regardless of what cache or normal "
"variables already exist.  This policy provides compatibility for projects "
"that have not been updated to expect this behavior."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy will only set normal variables for "

"when :command:`project` is called. The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy will "
