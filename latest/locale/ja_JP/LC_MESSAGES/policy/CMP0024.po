"CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed use of the :command:`include` command with "
"the result of the :command:`export` command.  This relies on the assumption "
"that the :command:`export` command has an immediate effect at configure-time "
"during a cmake run.  Certain properties of targets are not fully determined "
"until later at generate-time, such as the link language and complete list of "
"link libraries.  Future refactoring will change the effect of the :command:"
"`export` command to be executed at generate-time.  Use ``ALIAS`` targets "
"instead in cases where the goal is to refer to targets by another name."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. "
"Prior to removal in CMake version |REMOVED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|, it could be "
"set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:`cmake_minimum_required`. If it "
"was not set, CMake |WARNED_OR_DID_NOT_WARN|, and used ``OLD`` behavior."
