msgid ""
"Ancient CMake versions once used ``<tgt>_LIB_DEPENDS`` cache entries to "
"propagate library link dependencies.  This has long been done by other "
"means, leaving the :command:`export_library_dependencies` command as the "
"only user of these values.  That command has long been disallowed by policy :"
"policy:`CMP0033`, but the ``<tgt>_LIB_DEPENDS`` cache entries were left for "
"compatibility with possible non-standard uses by projects."

msgid ""
"CMake 3.12 and above now prefer to not produce these cache entries at all.  "
"This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated "
"to avoid using them."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to set ``<tgt>_LIB_DEPENDS`` cache "

"This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. "
"It may be set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:"
