"The :command:`try_compile` command source-file signature generates a "
"``CMakeLists.txt`` file to build the source file into an executable. In "
"order to compile the source the same way as it might be compiled by the "
"calling project, the generated project sets the value of the :variable:"
"`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` variable to that in the calling project. The value of "
"the :variable:`CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS` variable may be needed in some cases "
"too, but CMake 3.1 and lower did not set it in the generated project.  CMake "
"3.2 and above prefer to set it so that linker flags are honored as well as "
"compiler flags.  This policy provides compatibility with the pre-3.2 "
"behavior."
