"Adds a subdirectory to the build.  The ``source_dir`` specifies the "
"directory in which the source ``CMakeLists.txt`` and code files are "
"located.  If it is a relative path, it will be evaluated with respect to the "
"current directory (the typical usage), but it may also be an absolute path.  "
"The ``binary_dir`` specifies the directory in which to place the output "
"files.  If it is a relative path, it will be evaluated with respect to the "
"current output directory, but it may also be an absolute path.  If "
"``binary_dir`` is not specified, the value of ``source_dir``, before "
"expanding any relative path, will be used (the typical usage).  The "
"``CMakeLists.txt`` file in the specified source directory will be processed "
"immediately by CMake before processing in the current input file continues "
"beyond this command."
