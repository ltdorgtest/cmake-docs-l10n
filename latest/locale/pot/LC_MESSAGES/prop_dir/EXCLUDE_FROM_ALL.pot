"Set this directory property to a true value on a subdirectory to exclude its "
"targets from the \"all\" target of its ancestors.  If excluded, running e.g. "
"``make`` in the parent directory will not build targets in the subdirectory "
"by default.  This does not affect the \"all\" target of the subdirectory "
"itself.  Running e.g. ``make`` inside the subdirectory will still build its "
"targets."

"``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` is meant for when the subdirectory contains a separate "
"part of the project that is useful, but not necessary, such as a set of "
"examples, or e.g. an integrated 3rd party library. Typically the "
"subdirectory should contain its own :command:`project` command invocation so "
"that a full build system will be generated in the subdirectory (such as a "
"Visual Studio IDE solution file).  Note that inter-target dependencies "
"supersede this exclusion.  If a target built by the parent project depends "
"on a target in the subdirectory, the dependee target will be included in the "
"parent project build system to satisfy the dependency."
