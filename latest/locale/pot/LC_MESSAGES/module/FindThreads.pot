"Multithreading enables concurrent execution within a single program, "
"typically by creating multiple threads of execution.  Most commonly, this is "
"done using libraries such as POSIX Threads (``pthreads``) on Unix-like "
"systems or Windows threads on Windows."

"This module abstracts the platform-specific differences and detects how to "
"enable thread support - whether it requires linking to a specific library, "
"adding compiler flags (like ``-pthread``), or both.  On some platforms, "
"threading is also implicitly available in default libraries without the need "
"to use additional flags or libraries."

msgid ""
"The C11 standard introduced a minimal cross-platform thread API via "
"``<threads.h>`` header file, and C++11 added ``<thread>`` header to the "
"standard library, offering high-level multithreading support.  These "
"standard headers allow writing portable threaded code at the language level, "
"without directly using platform-specific APIs like ``pthreads`` or Windows "
"threads."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../../Modules/FindThreads.cmake:42
msgid ""
"However, even with standard C11 or C++11 threads support available, there "
"may still be a need for platform-specific compiler or linker flags (e.g., ``-"
"pthread`` on Unix-like systems) for some applications.  This is where "
"FindThreads remains relevant - it ensures these flags and any required "
"libraries are correctly set up, even if not explicitly using system APIs."
