"If the HDF5 library is built using its CMake-based build system, it will as "
"of HDF5 version 1.8.15 provide its own CMake Package Configuration file "

"If the upstream configuration file is not found, this module falls back to "
"*module mode* and invokes the HDF5 wrapper compiler typically installed with "
"the HDF5 library.  Depending on the configuration, this wrapper compiler is "
"named either ``h5cc`` (serial) or ``h5pcc`` (parallel).  If found, the "
"wrapper is queried with the ``-show`` argument to determine the compiler and "
"linker flags required for building an HDF5 client application. Both serial "
"and parallel versions of the HDF5 wrapper are considered.  The first "
"directory containing either is used.  If both versions are found in the same "
"directory, the serial version is preferred by default.  To change this "
