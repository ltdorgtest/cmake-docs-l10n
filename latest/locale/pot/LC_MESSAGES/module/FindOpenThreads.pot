"This module was originally introduced to support the :module:"
"`FindOpenSceneGraph` module and its components.  To simplify one-step "
"automated configuration and builds when the OpenSceneGraph package is "
"developed and distributed upstream, this module supports additional "
"environment variables to find dependencies in specific locations.  This "
"approach is used by upstream package over specifying ``-DVAR=value`` on the "
"command line because it offers better isolation from internal changes to the "
"module and allows more flexibility when specifying individual OSG components "
"independently of the ``CMAKE_*_PATH`` variables.  Explicit ``-DVAR=value`` "
"arguments can still override these settings if needed.  Since OpenThreads is "
"an optional standalone dependency of OpenSceneGraph, this module also honors "
"the following variables for convenience:"
