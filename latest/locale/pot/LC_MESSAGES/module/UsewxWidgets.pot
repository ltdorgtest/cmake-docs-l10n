"As of CMake 3.27, a better approach is to link only the :module:`wxWidgets::"
"wxWidgets <FindwxWidgets>` imported target to specific targets that require "
"it, rather than including this module.  Imported targets provide better "
"control of the package usage properties, such as include directories and "
"compile flags, by applying them only to the targets they are linked to, "
