"Code generation is a ubiquitous mechanism for extending programming "
"languages beyond the bounds of their language model. CMake has first-class "
"support for Qt's Meta-Object Compiler, but very few other code generators "
"are notable enough to warrant that kind of effort."
msgstr ""

"Instead, code generators tend to be bespoke and usage specific. CMake "
"provides facilities for describing the usage of a code generator, so "
"projects can add support for their individual needs."

msgid ""
"Any step in the build process can generally be described in terms of its "
"inputs and outputs. CMake assumes that code generators and other custom "
"processes operate on the same principle. In this way, the code generator "
"acts identically to compilers, linkers, and other elements of the toolchain; "
"when the inputs are newer than the outputs (or the outputs don't exist), a "
"user-specified command will be run to update the outputs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../guide/tutorial/Custom Commands and Generated Files.rst:27
msgid ""
"This model assumes the outputs of a process are known before it is run. "
"CMake lacks the ability to describe code generators where the name and "
"location of the outputs depends on the *content* of the input. Various hacks "
"exist to shim this functionality into CMake, but they are outside the scope "
"of this tutorial."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../guide/tutorial/Custom Commands and Generated Files.rst:33
msgid ""
"Describing a code generator (or any custom process) is usually performed in "
"two parts. First, the inputs and outputs are described independently of the "
"CMake target model, concerned only with the generation process itself. "
"Second, the outputs are associated with a CMake target to insert them into "
"the CMake target model."

"For sources, this is as simple as adding the generated files to the source "
"list of a ``STATIC``, ``SHARED``, or ``OBJECT`` library. For header-only "
"generators, it's often necessary to use an intermediary target created via :"
"command:`add_custom_target` to add the header file generation to the build "
"stage (because ``INTERFACE`` libraries have no build step)."
