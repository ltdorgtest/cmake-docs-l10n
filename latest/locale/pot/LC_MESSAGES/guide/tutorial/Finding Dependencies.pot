"In C/C++ software development, managing build dependencies is consistently "
"one of the highest ranked challenges facing modern developers. CMake "
"provides an extensive toolset for discovering and validating dependencies of "
"different kinds."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../guide/tutorial/Finding Dependencies.rst:9

"However, for correctly packaged projects there is no need to use these "
"advanced tools. Many popular library and utility projects today produce "
