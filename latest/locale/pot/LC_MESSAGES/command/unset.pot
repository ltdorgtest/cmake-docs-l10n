"When evaluating :ref:`Variable References` of the form ``${VAR}``, CMake "
"first searches for a normal variable with that name.  If no such normal "
"variable exists, CMake will then search for a cache entry with that name. "
"Because of this, **unsetting a normal variable can expose a cache variable "
"that was previously hidden**.  To force a variable reference of the form "
"``${VAR}`` to return an empty string, use ``set(<variable> \"\")``, which "
"clears the normal variable but leaves it defined."
