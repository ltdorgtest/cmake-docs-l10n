"Removed.  This once generated Visual Studio 11 2012 project files, but the "
"generator has been removed since CMake 3.28.  It is still possible to build "
"with the VS 11 2012 toolset by also installing VS 2015 (or above) and using "
"the :generator:`Visual Studio 14 2015` (or above) generator with :variable:"
"`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET` set to ``v110``, or by using the :generator:`NMake "
"Makefiles` generator."
