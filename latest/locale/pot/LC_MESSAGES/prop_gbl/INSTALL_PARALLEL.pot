"When this property is enabled, ``cmake --install`` can be given the ``-j "

"Calls to :command:`install(CODE)` or :command:`install(SCRIPT)` might depend "
"on actions performed by an earlier :command:`install` command in a different "
"directory such as files installed or variable settings. If the project has "
"such order-dependent installation logic, parallel installation should not be "
"enabled, in order to prevent possible race conditions."
