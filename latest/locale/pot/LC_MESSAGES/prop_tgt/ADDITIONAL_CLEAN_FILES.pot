"A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of files or directories that will be "
"removed as a part of the global ``clean`` target.  It can be used to specify "
"files and directories that are generated as part of building the target or "
"that are directly associated with the target in some way (e.g. created as a "
"result of running the target)."

"For custom targets, if such files can be captured as outputs or byproducts "
"instead, then that should be preferred over adding them to this property. If "
"an additional clean file is used by multiple targets or isn't target-"
"specific, then the :prop_dir:`ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES` directory property may "
"be the more appropriate property to use."
