"def``) file with all global symbols found in the input ``.obj`` files for a "
"``SHARED`` library (or executable with :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS`) on "

"This simplifies porting projects to Windows by reducing the need for "
"explicit ``dllexport`` markup, even in ``C++`` classes.  Function symbols "
"will be automatically exported and may be linked by callers. However, there "
"are some cases when compiling code in a consumer may require explicit "
"``dllimport`` markup:"

"In cases that the compiler generates references to the virtual function "

"When this property is enabled, zero or more ``.def`` files may also be "
"specified as source files of the target.  The exports named by these files "
"will be merged with those detected from the object files to generate a "
"single module definition file to be passed to the linker.  This can be used "
"to export symbols from a ``.dll`` that are not in any of its object files "
"but are added by the linker from dependencies (e.g. ``msvcrt.lib``)."
