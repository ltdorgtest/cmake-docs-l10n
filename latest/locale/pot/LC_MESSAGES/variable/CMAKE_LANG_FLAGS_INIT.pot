"Value used to initialize the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` cache entry the "
"first time a build tree is configured for language ``<LANG>``. This variable "
"is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file <CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.  "
"CMake may prepend or append content to the value based on the environment "
"and target platform.  For example, the contents of a ``xxxFLAGS`` "
"environment variable will be prepended, where ``xxx`` will be language-"
"specific but not necessarily the same as ``<LANG>`` (e.g. :envvar:`CXXFLAGS` "
"for ``CXX``, :envvar:`FFLAGS` for ``Fortran``, and so on). This value is a "
"command-line string fragment. Therefore, multiple options should be "
"separated by spaces, and options with spaces should be quoted."
