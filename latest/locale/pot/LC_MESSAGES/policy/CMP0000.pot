"CMake requires that projects specify the version of CMake to which they have "
"been written.  This policy has been put in place so users trying to build "
"the project may be told when they need to update their CMake.  Specifying a "
"version also helps the project build with CMake versions newer than that "
"specified.  Use the :command:`cmake_minimum_required` command at the top of "
"your main ``CMakeLists.txt`` file:"

"where ``<major>.<minor>`` is the version of CMake you want to support (such "

"Note that the command invocation must appear in the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file "
