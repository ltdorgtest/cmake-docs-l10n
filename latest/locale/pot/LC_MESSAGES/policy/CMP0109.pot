"In CMake 3.18 and below, the :command:`find_program` command on UNIX would "
"find files that are readable without requiring execute permission, and would "
"not find files that are executable without read permission. In CMake 3.19 "
"and above, ``find_program`` now prefers to require execute permission but "
"not read permission.  This policy provides compatibility with projects that "
"have not been updated to expect the new behavior."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is for ``find_program`` to require read "
