"When enabling the ``ASM`` language, CMake considers C compiler drivers as "
"assembler candidates.  CMake 4.0 and below accidentally selected MSVC's "
"``cl`` compiler as the ``CMAKE_ASM_COMPILER``, allowing the ``ASM`` language "
"to be enabled on Windows even though ``cl`` does not support assembler "
"sources.  CMake 4.1 and above prefer to reject ``cl`` as an assembler "
"candidate, but some existing projects unconditionally enable ``ASM`` on "
"Windows even though they add no assembler sources.  This policy provides "
"compatibility for such projects to allow them to configure as before."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to successfully enable ``ASM`` even "
"if ``cl`` is the only available candidate.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this "
"policy is to not consider ``cl`` as a candidate assembler for the ``ASM`` "
"language."
