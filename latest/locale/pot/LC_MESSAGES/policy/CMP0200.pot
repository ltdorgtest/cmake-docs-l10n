"The way CMake historically selected the configuration to use for imported "
"targets prioritized selection based on location properties for a candidate "
"configuration and only considered :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS` as a "
"fallback.  This could result in incorrect configuration selection especially "
"for ``INTERFACE`` libraries."

"CMake 4.2 and above consider :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS` to be a "
"definitive list of available configurations, regardless of whether a "
"configuration specific location is provided for the library.  Additionally, "

"specific location is not specified."

"This policy provides compatibility with projects that rely on the historical "
"behavior.  The policy setting applies to targets and is recorded at the "
"point an imported target is created.  Accordingly, imported packages may "
"override the policy set by the consumer for targets they create.  In "
"particular, targets imported from |CPS| packages always use the ``NEW`` "
"behavior."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to retain the historic behavior. The "

"If :prop_tgt:`MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>` (where ``<CONFIG>`` is the "

"would historically select from that list the first configuration which "
"provides a configuration-specific location.  If no such configuration "
"exists, CMake would selects the consuming target's configuration, if the "
"imported target is an ``INTERFACE`` library.  Otherwise, CMake considers the "
"target as not having a suitable configuration."

"For ``INTERFACE`` libraries which do not provide a location, this results in "

"\"usable\" means that a location (either configuration-specific or "
