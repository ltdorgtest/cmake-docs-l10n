"CMake 2.8.12 introduced the :command:`target_link_libraries` signature using "
"the ``PUBLIC``, ``PRIVATE``, and ``INTERFACE`` keywords to generalize the "
"``LINK_PUBLIC`` and ``LINK_PRIVATE`` keywords introduced in CMake 2.8.7. Use "
"of signatures with any of these keywords sets the link interface of a target "
"explicitly, even if empty.  This produces confusing behavior when used in "
"combination with the historical behavior of the plain :command:"
"`target_link_libraries` signature.  For example, consider the code:"

"After the first line the link interface has not been set explicitly so CMake "
"would use the link implementation, A, as the link interface. However, the "
"second line sets the link interface to empty.  In order to avoid this subtle "
"behavior CMake now prefers to disallow mixing the plain and keyword "
"signatures of :command:`target_link_libraries` for a single target."
