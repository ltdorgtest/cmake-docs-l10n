msgid ""
"Before CMake 3.29, the :variable:`CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS` variable is "
"unset by default.  When using the :cpack_gen:`CPack productbuild Generator`, "
"this disables the use of the ``domains`` attribute in the productbuild "
"Distribution XML, and falls back to the ``auth`` attribute instead. These "
"attributes control where a productbuild package is allowed to be installed.  "
"But the ``auth`` attribute has been deprecated by Apple, so projects should "
"migrate to using ``domains`` instead."

"CMake 3.29 and above prefer to use a default value of true for :variable:"
"`CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS`, which means ``domains`` will be used by "
"default unless the project explicitly sets :variable:"
"`CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS` to false. This policy provides compatibility "
"with projects that enabled the :cpack_gen:`CPack productbuild Generator`, "
"but did not explicitly set :variable:`CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS`."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to leave :variable:"
