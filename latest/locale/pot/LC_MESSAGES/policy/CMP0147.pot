"Visual Studio 15.8 (2017) and newer support building custom commands in "
"parallel.  CMake 3.27 and above prefer to enable this behavior by adding a "
"``BuildInParallel`` setting to custom commands in ``.vcxproj`` files. This "
"policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated to "
"expect this, e.g., because their custom commands were accidentally relying "
"on serial execution by MSBuild. To control this behavior in a more precise "
"way, refer to :prop_sf:`VS_CUSTOM_COMMAND_DISABLE_PARALLEL_BUILD`."
