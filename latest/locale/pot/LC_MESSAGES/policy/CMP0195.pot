"The Swift compiler emits several supplementary files that make up the "
"interface to a Swift library.  It accepts finding these files separately or "
"in a single swiftmodule directory.  The single file keeps things better "
"organized and makes it easier to install the resulting products."

"CMake versions 4.1 and above prefer to generate the modules in the directory "

"new behavior."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to emit the interface files directly "
"into the current binary directory. The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is "
"to gather the binary swiftmodule and other supplemental compiler outputs in "
"a single Swift module directory."
