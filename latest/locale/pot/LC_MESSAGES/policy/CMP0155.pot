"CMake 3.27 and below assume that C++ sources do not ``import`` modules. "
"CMake 3.28 and above prefer to assume that C++ sources in targets using C+"
"+20 or higher might ``import`` modules, and must be scanned before "
"compiling, unless explicitly disabled.  This policy provides compatibility "
"for projects that use C++20 or higher, without modules, that have not been "
"updated to turn off scanning, e.g., via the :variable:"
"`CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES` variable. See the :manual:`cmake-cxxmodules(7)` "
"manual for more details on C++ module support."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to assume that C++ 20 and newer "
"sources do not import modules.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to "
"assume that C++ 20 and newer files may import modules if the compiler "
"understands how to scan for their dependencies, and need to be scanned."
