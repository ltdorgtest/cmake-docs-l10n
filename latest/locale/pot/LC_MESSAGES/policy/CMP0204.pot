"In CMake 4.1 and below, :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` compile sources in "
"with ``_MBCS``, ``_UNICODE`` or ``_SBCS`` defined due to behavior of Visual "
"Studio itself.  The preprocessor definition is not modeled by CMake and is "
"therefore not added by other generators, such as :generator:`Ninja`."

"CMake 4.2 and above, when targeting the MSVC ABI, prefer to compile sources "
"with ``_MBCS`` defined by all generators unless another charset preprocessor "
"definition is found (``_UNICODE`` or ``_SBCS``). This policy provides "
"compatibility with projects that have not been updated to be aware of the "
"definition.  Its setting is recorded by each target as it is created, and "
"affects compilation of sources in that target."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy does not model the ``_MBCS`` "
"preprocessor definition in CMake itself.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this "
