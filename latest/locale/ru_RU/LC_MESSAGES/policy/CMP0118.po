":prop_sf:`GENERATED` sources may be used across directories without manual "

msgid ""
"In CMake 3.19 and below, the :prop_sf:`GENERATED` source file property, like "
"other source file properties, was scoped in every directory separately. If a "
"source file was generated in one directory, projects had to manually set the "
"``GENERATED`` property in another directory in order to use the file."

msgid ""
"Whether or not a source file is generated is an all-or-nothing global "
"property of the source: a source is either generated or it is not. CMake "
"3.20 and above prefer to allow source files generated in one directory to be "
"used in other directories without manually marking them as ``GENERATED``. "
"Additionally, the ``GENERATED`` property may now be set only to boolean "
"values, and may not be turned off once turned on.  This policy provides "
"compatibility for projects that have not been updated for this behavior."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to allow generated files to be used "
"only in directories in which their ``GENERATED`` property has been turned "
"on. The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to allow generated files to be "
"used in other directories without explicitly turning on the ``GENERATED`` "
"property for those directories."

"Policy :policy:`CMP0163` additionally makes the :prop_sf:`GENERATED` source "
"file property visible to :command:`get_property` and :command:"
"`get_source_file_property` calls in other directories."

msgid ""
"This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. "
"It may be set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:"
"`cmake_minimum_required`. If it is not set, CMake |WARNS_OR_DOES_NOT_WARN|, "
"and uses ``OLD`` behavior."
