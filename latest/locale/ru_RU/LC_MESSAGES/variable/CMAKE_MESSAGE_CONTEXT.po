"When enabled by the :option:`cmake --log-context` command line option or "
"the :variable:`CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT_SHOW` variable, the :command:`message` "
"command converts the ``CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT`` list into a dot-separated "
"string surrounded by square brackets and prepends it to each line for "
"messages of log levels ``NOTICE`` and below."

"For logging contexts to work effectively, projects should generally "
"``APPEND`` and ``POP_BACK`` an item to the current value of "
"``CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT`` rather than replace it. Projects should not assume "
"the message context at the top of the source tree is empty, as there are "
"scenarios where the context might have already been set (e.g. hierarchical "
"projects)."

"Valid context names are restricted to anything that could be used as a CMake "
"variable name.  All names that begin with an underscore or the string "
"``cmake_`` are also reserved for use by CMake and should not be used by "
