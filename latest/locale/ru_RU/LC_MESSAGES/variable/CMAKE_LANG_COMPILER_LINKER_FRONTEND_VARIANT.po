"Some linkers have multiple, different frontends for accepting command line "
"options.  For example, ``LLVM LLD`` originally only had a frontend "
"compatible with the ``GNU`` compiler, but since its port to Windows (``lld-"
"link``), it now also supports a frontend compatible with ``MSVC``. When "
"CMake detects such a linker, it sets this variable to what would have been "
"the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_LINKER_ID` for the linker whose "
"frontend it resembles."
