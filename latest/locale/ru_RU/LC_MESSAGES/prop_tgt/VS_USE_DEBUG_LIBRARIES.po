msgid ""
"The \"Use Debug Libraries\" setting in Visual Studio projects, despite its "
"specific-sounding name, is a general-purpose indicator of what "
"configurations are considered debug configurations.  In standalone projects, "
"this may affect MSBuild's default selection of MSVC runtime library, "
"optimization flags, runtime checks, and similar settings.  In CMake projects "
"those settings are typically generated explicitly based on the project's "
"specification, e.g., the MSVC runtime library is controlled by |"
"MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY|.  However, the ``UseDebugLibraries`` indicator is "
"useful for reference by both humans and tools, and may also affect the "
"behavior of platform-specific SDKs."

"Set |VS_USE_DEBUG_LIBRARIES| to a true or false value to indicate whether "
"each configuration is considered a debug configuration.  The value may also "
"be the empty string (``\"\"``) in which case no ``UseDebugLibraries`` will "
"be added explicitly by CMake, and MSBuild will use its default value, "
"``false``."
