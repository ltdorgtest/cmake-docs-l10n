"Targets may populate this property to publish the |property_name| required "
"to compile against the headers for the target.  The |command_name| command "
"populates this property with values given to the ``PUBLIC`` and "

"When target dependencies are specified using :command:"

"Contents of |PROPERTY_INTERFACE_NAME| may use \"generator expressions\" with "

"When a device link step is involved, which is controlled by :prop_tgt:"
"`CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION` and :prop_tgt:`CUDA_RESOLVE_DEVICE_SYMBOLS` "
"properties and policy :policy:`CMP0105`, the raw options will be delivered "
"to the host and device link steps (wrapped in ``-Xcompiler`` or equivalent "
"for device link). Options wrapped with :genex:`$<DEVICE_LINK:...>` generator "
"expression will be used only for the device link step. Options wrapped with :"
"genex:`$<HOST_LINK:...>` generator expression will be used only for the host "
"link step."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../command/OPTIONS_SHELL.txt:4
msgid ""
"The final set of options used for a target is constructed by accumulating "
"options from the current target and the usage requirements of its "
"dependencies.  The set of options is de-duplicated to avoid repetition."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../command/OPTIONS_SHELL.txt:8
msgid ""
"While beneficial for individual options, the de-duplication step can break "
"up option groups.  For example, ``-option A -option B`` becomes ``-option A "
"B``.  One may specify a group of options using shell-like quoting along with "
"a ``SHELL:`` prefix.  The ``SHELL:`` prefix is dropped, and the rest of the "
"option string is parsed using the :command:`separate_arguments` "
"``UNIX_COMMAND`` mode. For example, ``\"SHELL:-option A\" \"SHELL:-option "
"B\"`` becomes ``-option A -option B``."

msgid ""
"To pass options to the linker tool, each compiler driver has its own syntax. "
"The ``LINKER:`` prefix and ``,`` separator can be used to specify, in a "
"portable way, options to pass to the linker tool. ``LINKER:`` is replaced by "
"the appropriate driver option and ``,`` by the appropriate driver separator. "
"The driver prefix and driver separator are given by the values of the :"
"variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG` and :variable:"
"`CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP` variables."

#: ../../../command/LINK_OPTIONS_LINKER.txt:12
msgid ""
"For example, ``\"LINKER:-z,defs\"`` becomes ``-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs`` "

#: ../../../command/LINK_OPTIONS_LINKER.txt:18

"The ``LINKER:`` prefix supports, as an alternative syntax, specification of "

"Specifying the ``SHELL:`` prefix anywhere other than at the beginning of the "
"``LINKER:`` prefix is not supported."
