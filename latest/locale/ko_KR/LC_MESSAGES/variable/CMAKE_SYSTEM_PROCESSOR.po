"When not cross-compiling, this variable has the same value as the :variable:"
"`CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR` variable.  In many cases, this will correspond "
"to the target architecture for the build, but this is not guaranteed.  (E.g. "
"on Windows, the host may be ``AMD64`` even when using a MSVC ``cl`` compiler "
"with a 32-bit target.)"

"When cross-compiling, a :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` should set the "
"``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR`` variable to match target architecture that it "
"specifies (via :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER` and perhaps :variable:"
"`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_TARGET`)."
