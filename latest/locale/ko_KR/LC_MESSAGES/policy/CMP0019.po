"CMake 2.8.10 and lower re-evaluated values given to the include_directories, "
"link_directories, and link_libraries commands to expand any leftover "
"variable references at the end of the configuration step.  This was for "
"strict compatibility with VERY early CMake versions because all variable "
"references are now normally evaluated during CMake language processing.  "
"CMake 2.8.11 and higher prefer to skip the extra evaluation."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. "
"Prior to removal in CMake version |REMOVED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|, it could be "
"set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:`cmake_minimum_required`. If it "
"was not set, CMake |WARNED_OR_DID_NOT_WARN|, and used ``OLD`` behavior."
