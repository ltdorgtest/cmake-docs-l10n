"Each exercise in this step will start with some background information. "
"Then, a goal and list of helpful resources are provided. Each file in the "
"``Files to Edit`` section is in the ``Step1`` directory and contains one or "

"change or add. The ``TODO`` s are intended to be completed in numerical "
"order, first complete  ``TODO 1`` then ``TODO 2``, etc. The ``Getting "
"Started`` section will give some helpful hints and guide you through the "
"exercise. Then the ``Build and Run`` section will walk step-by-step through "
"how to build and test the exercise. Finally, at the end of each exercise the "
"intended solution is discussed."
