"Some CMake generators support selection of an instance of the native build "
"system when multiple instances are available.  If the user specifies an "
"instance (e.g. by setting this cache entry or via the :envvar:"
"`CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE` environment variable), or after a default "
"instance is chosen when a build tree is first configured, the value will be "
"available in this variable."

"The value of this variable should never be modified by project code. A "
"toolchain file specified by the :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` variable "
"may initialize ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE`` as a cache entry. Once a given "
"build tree has been initialized with a particular value for this variable, "
"changing the value has undefined behavior."
