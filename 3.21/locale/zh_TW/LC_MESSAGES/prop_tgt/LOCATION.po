"For a non-imported target, this property is provided for compatibility with "
"CMake 2.4 and below.  It was meant to get the location of an executable "
"target's output file for use in :command:`add_custom_command`.  The path may "
"contain a build-system-specific portion that is replaced at build time with "
"the configuration getting built (such as ``$(ConfigurationName)`` in VS).  "
"In CMake 2.6 and above :command:`add_custom_command` automatically "
"recognizes a target name in its ``COMMAND`` and ``DEPENDS`` options and "
"computes the target location.  In CMake 2.8.4 and above :command:"
"`add_custom_command` recognizes :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-"
"generator-expressions(7)>` to refer to target locations anywhere in the "
"command. Therefore this property is not needed for creating custom commands."

"Do not set properties that affect the location of a target after reading "
"this property.  These include properties whose names match ``(RUNTIME|"
"LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_<CONFIG>)?``, ``(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|"
"SUFFIX)``, or \"LINKER_LANGUAGE\".  Failure to follow this rule is not "
"diagnosed and leaves the location of the target undefined."
