"The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for invalid indices to be treated as "
"their integer value (if any) at the start of the string. For example, "
"``2good4you`` is a ``2`` and ``not_an_integer`` is a ``0``. The ``NEW`` "
"behavior is for invalid indices to trigger an error."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.21.  CMake version |release| "

"`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly."
