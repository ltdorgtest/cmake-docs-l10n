"Let us consider adding some code to our project that depends on features the "
"target platform may not have. For this example, we will add some code that "
"depends on whether or not the target platform has the ``log`` and ``exp`` "
"functions. Of course almost every platform has these functions but for this "
"tutorial assume that they are not common."

"of these functions using the :module:`CheckSymbolExists` module in "

"the ``m`` library. If ``log`` and ``exp`` are not initially found, require "
