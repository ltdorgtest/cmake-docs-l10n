"Adds the paths in which the linker should search for libraries. Relative "

"The directories are added to the :prop_dir:`LINK_DIRECTORIES` directory "
"property for the current ``CMakeLists.txt`` file, converting relative paths "
"to absolute as needed.  See the :manual:`cmake-buildsystem(7)` manual for "
"more on defining buildsystem properties."

"By default the directories specified are appended onto the current list of "
"directories.  This default behavior can be changed by setting :variable:"
"`CMAKE_LINK_DIRECTORIES_BEFORE` to ``ON``.  By using ``AFTER`` or ``BEFORE`` "
"explicitly, you can select between appending and prepending, independent of "
"the default."

"This command is rarely necessary and should be avoided where there are other "
"choices.  Prefer to pass full absolute paths to libraries where possible, "
"since this ensures the correct library will always be linked. The :command:"
"`find_library` command provides the full path, which can generally be used "
"directly in calls to :command:`target_link_libraries`. Situations where a "
"library search path may be needed include:"

#: ../../../command/link_directories.rst:43
msgid ""
"Project generators like Xcode where the user can switch target architecture "
"at build time, but a full path to a library cannot be used because it only "
"provides one architecture (i.e. it is not a universal binary)."

#: ../../../command/link_directories.rst:47
msgid ""
"Libraries may themselves have other private library dependencies that expect "
"to be found via ``RPATH`` mechanisms, but some linkers are not able to fully "
"decode those paths (e.g. due to the presence of things like ``$ORIGIN``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../command/link_directories.rst:52
msgid ""
"If a library search path must be provided, prefer to localize the effect "
"where possible by using the :command:`target_link_directories` command "
"rather than ``link_directories()``.  The target-specific command can also "
"control how the search directories propagate to other dependent targets."
